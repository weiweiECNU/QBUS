41,4,N,Beauty,B000F5PM4E,"Elon Matrix 5,000 - Vitamin for Hair 60 tablets","My husband commented on how good my hair looks since I started this, thick, clear and even toned","My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Hndv ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />My personal physician told me that Biotin's role is multi-faceted and the vitamin is used for a number of different purposes.<br />1) Hair, Skin, Nails: Biotin is said to help grow healthy hair, is good for the skin and is used to help treat brittle toe and fingernails. Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.<br />2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.<br />3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a ""fat burner"" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.<br />4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.<br />5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.<br />6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.<br /><br />My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn't successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair. I haven't seen much growth in the length, but it is very much thicker, prettier, and more manageable. It's so much so that my hairdresser was very surprised! When I went to her to get a trim 2 months after the last haircut, it had grown to the level which would normally have taken 3 months at least to reach :)"

Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />He told that the extract of pine bark has a beneficial effect in treating over 50 diseases associated with the effects of free radicals, and also provides prevention against them:<br />1) Asthma<br />2) Chronic venous insufficiency (a condition that involves leg swelling, 3) varicose veins, pain, itching, and other skin changes)<br />4) High blood pressure (hypertension)<br />5) Retinopathy (an eye condition commonly caused by diabetes)<br />6) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<br />7) Blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)<br />8) Diabetes<br />9) Impotence (also known as erectile dysfunction or ED)<br />10) High cholesterol<br />11) Male infertility<br />12) Heart attacks or strokes<br />13) Leg cramps<br />14) Pregnancy pains (such as back pain, pelvic pain, and leg cramps)<br />15) Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea).<br />16) Pycnogenol is also said to improve athletic performance.<br /><br />""So, tell me what it cant heal?"" I asked. But whatever I had a try. I use it in my type 2 diabetes herbal treatment regimen and to add preventative circulatory and longevity potential to my life one veggie cap at a time. I have been taking this pycogenol for about a month so far and the main thing I have noticed is that my allergies/cough have pretty much gone away completely. At the beginning of January this year I got sick with a pretty bad cold and have had a cough ever since that is only at night and in the morning. My doctor told me that it was most likely allergies or asthma, neither of which I have had before. The pycogenol is the only thing I have added to my regimen of vitamins/supplements in the past month and now my cough is gone.Yay!! I am also hoping this will help with my diabetes which was the reason that I started taking it so hopefully I can report back seeing a benefit on that soon too. I plan to starttaking this twice a day instead of once so I'm hoping that will help."

80,3,Y,Video DVD,B0094J4CD4,"Tiny Tutor: Letters, Numbers, Shapes & Colors (4 DVDs)","Great for kids, boring for adults","My 19 month old loves these videos, especially the shapes DVD for some reason. She can say circle and star now, and recognizes some others when she plays with her [[ASIN:B0089W1IGG Baby's First Blocks]]. She can also count from one to five, and names a few letters here and there.<br /><br />I give the videos credit that they hold her attention and she has learned a lot from them. They are slow paced and not too flashy like most cartoons on TV. The animations are colorful and the music is decent.<br /><br />However, they get boring for adults to watch. The videos repeat the word over and over again, which gets tiring for me to listen to. In all fairness the repetition definitely helps her to learn faster so I guess I should just deal with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* The videos work well.<br />* My daughter loves them.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Boring for adults to watch."

114,4,N,Health & Personal Care,B004Q8JH9M,"Pampers Cruisers Diapers Size 4 Economy Pack Plus,160 Count",Good for mobility,"We changed from swaddlers to cruisers when our baby started to crawl excessively. The diapers moved with her better and gave a lot better coverage. Swaddlers were not so leak proof with an active baby. I think she also likes the these better- she seems to smile when she sees them. There've been some changes in the last pack compared to original cruisers though. There liner is the same color as the diaper again and they're thinner. Sometimes the thinner consistency poses a problem, sometimes it does not. It really depends on the day and how much she's gotta go.<br /><br />They seem to hold well overnight- no leaks, but it's not as dry either. As a result, our poor little Lucy has got some diaper rash a few times. She's a screamer when she's got it bad. In those instances we use a heavy strength rash cream by bourdeaux butt paste brand: [[ASIN:B00BMIT1U4 All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste Diaper Rash Ointment + FREE Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Lotion]]. It absorbs well so it's not left all messy and residue on the diaper when you put a fresh one on. Anything still there at the next change wipes right off her bottom with ease too."

Although, after using it for 6 weeks fairly regularly, I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Normally people keep eating unhealthy or don't stay active during the use of these kinds of products, but I didn't do that at all. I honestly didn't lose more than 2 pounds at any time during the use of this product. It was hard to comprehend that even after that much regular use, I wasn't losing weight.<br /><br />After realizing this, I decided to try something new. After consulting with friends and family, I went with a product that has been nothing short of AMAZING. I have lost 23 pounds in the last 7 weeks and I have never felt better. This is only the start! I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long to find something that worked for me.<br /><br />If you want to actually lose weight, take a look at this item here on Amazon and give it a chance ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1jSaoQQ<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the product for you, I'm at least glad I could share my experience about this product and how it did not work for me.

412,3,N,Books,0983624534,Hell,Filthy Language,"The author of ""Hell"" seems to recognize the need for tradition if the Bible is to have any meaning at all. Think how someone entirely unfamiliar with Judaism, Christianity and the Bible would react if he read the Bible without any guidance, for the first time, in a set of unbound pages. He likely wouldn't see in it any order or unity as a book.<br /><br />In ""How to Stop Believing in Hell"" (on the Kindle list) the narrator describes his life and slow release from spiritual terror without reliance on any religion other than the one he is abandoning. He rejects all the usual doctrines: the existence of the will, morality, the infallibility of any book or person, immortality, the existence of the soul, eternity, Heaven, Purgatory, Armageddon, and Divine judgement. Only then does he find the love of his Creator and cease to fear Hell. It's exciting reading and can be found on Kindle's list."

So when I saw this in a store i thought - great, I could get to read on about Ender and his battles.  However, in order for this book to make some sense, the author had to rework the plot into the plot of Ender's Game, though it was not intented to be in it from the start. For instance, Bean states that during the great battles on Eros, he had to know where every ship was in order to be able to take over if Ender collapsed. However, in Ender's Game, Ender clearly states that the one who had overcontrol over half the fleet was Alai, who was almsot as good as Ender, according to Ender himself. In order to solve this discrepency, the author had Bean state that his performance was reduced because he had to do his part in the battles and also udnerstand the overall strategy, which explains his mediocre performance. In my opinion, this was just the author making excuses.  Not a terrible book, just not a very good one, especially considering how good Ender's Game was. The author would have madea far better job if he had written a book involving Bean five years after the events of Ender's Game, and not relive them from Bean's perspective."

1032,1,N,Electronics,B00I9HC50O,Grace Digital GDI-BTAR512 100-Watt Digital Integrated Stereo Amplifier with Built-In AptX Bluetooth Wireless Receiver (Black),Annoying hissing,This amplifier seemed like the perfect solution for my problem. I wanted an integrated solution to stream music from my iPhone to a pair of floor-standing speakers wirelessly. My speakers do not have wireless and I did not like having a separate wireless receiver and amplifier. Since my phone supports Bluetooth I gave this amp a try.<br /><br />It worked as long as the distance between my phone and speakers was within 20 feet before cutting out. The build quality seems a bit cheap but for the price I guess that is what you get.<br /><br />The real bummer however was the fact that there is a constant hiss in the audio. I think this hiss is generated by the amplifier itself. If I turn down the volume the hiss goes down. If I turn it up the hiss comes back. This is very annoying since I otherwise would have liked this product. Unfortunately this constant white noise is driving me crazy. I have since returned this unit and purchased a similar product from another vendor.

I have tried it on separate occasions and so far, I have not been able to get even 4000 mAh from it. Not a big deal for me because a full charge for each phone is all I need when traveling.

Great statistics, horribly uncomfortable!!!","This carseat has great reviews in terms of how safe it is.  A look at the reports and stats involved with testing this carseat are impressive.  What they forgot in designing this carseat, however, is comfort (both for the Mom and the Baby).  My baby HATES sitting in this carseat.  It's super-narrow and deep.  Maybe the depth is what makes it so safe but I wonder if it's worth it to have your baby be uncomfortable each and every time you take a car ride. In terms of discomfort for the Mom: this car seat is heavy and bulky.  I hurt my back hauling it with a three week old so I would suggest really thinking about how much you might be moving the car seat around (I live in NYC and I take the car seat out to use in its frame as a stroller--or I used to until I decided to get rid of this monster).<br /><br />I got this car seat off of my registry and was really thankful for it but this thing is a beast!<br /><br />My husband and I recently purchased a comparatively cheap Graco carseat to use at his parents' home and my baby LOVES it.

At first it was okay, but I've had it for about 9 months now, and I get extremely frustrated with it.<br /><br />The lag is HORRIBLE. If I try to call someone, it usually takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 3-4 minutes to actually place the call. It gets really frustrating. I'll press the call button and wait a few minutes before it actually calls. A lot of the time I'll receive a call from the person while I'm trying to call them because they're tired of waiting for the call to go through. Then I'm dialing them and they're calling me at the same time, and hanging up ends both the calls and we have to start over. It's pretty ridiculous.<br /><br />The apps freeze and crash a lot - and not just downloaded apps, ALL of the apps on the phone. If I go to my contacts and try to call someone, the app freezes and says it has to close and I have to reopen it. This happens a lot with messaging, too. I'll try to click on a message and the app freezes and force closes. Also, there's a weird glitch where I open a message and try to type, and it won't let me. I have to tap on the message box over and over again, sometimes for a couple of minutes, before it finally lets me type. If I type a word, it shows that I'm trying to type it and then deletes each letter as I type it.<br /><br />The memory is pretty bad. I was going to just get an SD card and use it to store apps and stuff so I could have more on the phone, but most of the apps won't even go on the SD card and have to be stored on the phone, so there's really no point. I have barely anything on my phone (maybe 5 apps and 150-200 pictures), and the memory is full.<br /><br />Another weird glitch I've been having is when I press the unlock button, nothing happens, and I have to press it about ten times before it actually responds and lets me unlock the phone.<br /><br />Overall a really crappy phone - I do NOT recommend getting it. It looks good at first, but the lag and horrible memory make it a very bad choice. If I had the money to get a new one, I would in a heartbeat so I wouldn't have to deal with this piece of crap anymore. I want to throw it at a wall every time I try to use it."

Everything is pre-installed, you don't have to do anything except connect to your screen and power supply. Of course, there are optional applications that came with a disc. Activation code is labeled on the computer. Everything works out fine. All the driver updates and applications that are necessary for your hard drive took about 10% of storage, something that I found some people do complain about. But nothing useless is found, unlike majority of pc on the market. Now as for gaming. It does allow you to run majority of games that are available. However, keep that in mind, lots of games have low requirements, so this hardware works just fine. I use mmohut as reference, but a lot game review sites have similar rating on games. For their top rate games, this computer is nothing to brag about. Many popular games have way too high requirement that is just out of this computer's league. It does allow me to play certain game like Soul of Ultimate Nation at high setting very smooth. For a casual gamer, less intensive applications, and for $500, this computer is truly a steal. But if you want to run heavy intensive games like WoW, Terra, and so on; you can settle for low setting or do some serious upgrades. My new parts are arriving soon, so I will update as soon as I can.<br /><br />Update: I bought AMD Radeon HD 7850 ($210) to replace the graphic card that came with the machine. Now this is truly a gaming computer. Everything is above 7.0 in Windows Index except hard drive. The new graphic card makes the machine runs extremely quiet, unlike before which felt a trunk driving by every single time it is turned on. Although I did upgrade the memory ram to 16GB, which I don't think it's really necessary for everyone. My advice to everyone that want to play some of the popular game today, upgrade to a better graphic card. Another thing I notice is that my computer's motherboard is GA-78LMT-S2, while current product description is ASRock 960GM-GS3 FX. They probably changed to the newer one.<br /><br />My rating still remains. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I do want to run the games I like in medium to high settings smoothly. This is also my first time to purchase a built PC and have upgrade it myself. I'm ok with what it is, and can be upgraded quite easily."

1368,1,N,Grocery,B00O41OKEI,ONE ORGANIC Matcha Green Tea Powder (250g) - USDA Certified Organic,One star - I am worried about lead contamination in matcha from China.,"Lead contamination of matcha is a real problem in China! I understand that lead has been entering the River Yangtze and East China Sea as a result of poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China (Huh and Chen 1999). Water irrigations systems for farms obtain water from the River Yangtze! As a result the tea plants do get contaminated with lead. Even organic farms in China are at risk. In 2006 Han et al showed that 32% of 1225 tea samples from China contained lead at levels that exceed the maximum permissible concentration. In 2013 Consumer Lab dot com advised people not to consume matcha from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha! The only way to be sure about the purity of the matcha is to see a lab report on the amount of lead in the matcha. Lead can damage any organ in the body including the brain, causing learning and behavioural problems and also problems with doing arithmetic or language problems.<br />I think it is important that a lab report on lead content of the matcha is uploaded on to Amazon by one organic as it is a matter of food safety. Until then I will not drink this matcha which clearly says on the back of the pack that it is a ""Product of China‚Äù. It is an important issue. Once I have seen the lab report on Amazon I will write what I thought about the appearance and taste of this matcha.<br /><br />It is useful to read ""SCALE AND CAUSES OF LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE TEA‚Äù and the Consumer Lab dot com article which you can find online. They are a real eye-opener!"

It sticks to the arm with no flexibility to allow free movement of the arm. I usually run 3-4 miles followed by 25 minutes of strength training. This armband was painful to wear for more than a mile. When I removed it after the run, the skin is flaming red in that spot.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but I think a more flexible material that doesn't cause so much friction would be better suited for this design. This material in itself is too painful to wear."

All-in-all it is a fun take on the old tale. (no new plot here, save for the in depth look at Tonto's past) Some Texas Rangers get ambushed and only one survives, leaving a Lone Ranger. A dead brother who's wife loved them both at one point, gives us a great damsel, add her impressionable son, a corrupt train mogul, a scary outlaw who eats parts of his victims, and a pair of hero's that carry the film with their antics, and you've got a good western romp. Depp plays a great Tonto, especially, the old Tonto that starts the flick.  My only negative is this: Two hours of  s - l - o - w  build up for thirty minutes of over the top climax is not that great of a ratio for a film. Thirty minutes of it could have been edited out and the thing would have been perfect.  4 stars, A ""Must See"" for fans of westerns, Depp, and The Lone Ranger. - MR"

1637,4,Y,Sports,B00B1N0R6C,Perfect Fitness Ab Carver Pro,My Ab Carver Pro Review,"The Perfect Fitness Ab Carver Pro was the first piece of equipment I purchased when I decided to create a home gym.  Along with this, a jump rope, and a waist trimmer belt, I lost 70 pounds over the past 7 months.  If you are just starting out, I'd recommend it be the first piece of equipment you get as well because it allows you to focus on the most important part of the body, THE CORE, which you should focus on first especially when you are just getting started or back into a workout routine.<br />I am not what you would call a bargain shopper (more like an impulse buyer ha) because if I were, I would have realized that you can get this same brand, and same model at Walmart for 10 dollars less than what it is selling for on amazon which is currently $39.95.  The Ab-Carver Pro is available on the Walmart web site right now for $29.77, so with the added tax (how does Amazon get away with not charging tax btw), you'll still save a fist full of dollars.<br /><br />If that is still too steep for you, and I totally understand if it is - still a lot of money to spend on a couple pieces of plastic, the best priced ab wheel I found on here appears to be this one for only $7.00 - [[ASIN:B00J0F3DR8 Wacces Ab Power Wheel Ab Roller]].  So, that is a good price, a great price actually.  Now you are probably asking yourself if you can get an ab wheel for such a ridiculously low price and it will do the job, then why on earth would you spend almost six times that amount and get the Ab Carver Pro!?<br /><br />While I think it may be overpriced, there are TWO key features on the Ab Carver Pro which make me not regret the purchase.  I only regret not getting it at Walmart lol.<br /><br />Key Feature #1:  The Wheel size is very very wide.  This makes a huge difference especially in the beginning.  The wider wheel provides more stability and the increased stability gives room for a greater range of motion which means more muscles are being contracted during the movement.  This translates into getting and seeing results a lot quicker.  When I first started, I highly doubt I could have even completed one full rep on a classic ab wheel but on this I was able to do sets of 6-7 full reps from day one.<br /><br />TIP FOR BEGINNERS:  Start on a wall, no kidding.  Lean into the wall at about 45% angle and start with higher reps of 15 up to 30.  Once you can do three full sets of 30 reps take it to the mat (or the knee pads they provide which I don't use personally)!<br /><br />Key Feature #2:  The Contoured handles really help with different angles.  Thr great thing about not being in the gym is I'm not stuck in those ab machines which force you to move in one range of motion over and over again hitting the same muscle fibers the same way, every time.  The handles it easy to hit every angle of your ab and core by moving in slightly different directions with each repettiton. With the Ab Carver, you can literally move in 20 different angles and better still, it doesn't bother my wrists either (like typing this review does for example!).<br /><br />The only other two pieces of equipment I have used and still use in my ""home gym"" are, as I mentioned earlier, a jump rope and a waist trimmer belt.<br /><br />I went through a couple jump ropes before landing on this one;  [[ASIN:B00GGKPCPG Buy Jump Ropes Double Unders Jump Rope]].  My biggest tip here is to make sure you get one that is adjustable in length like this one.  If its too long you're not going to be able to pick up enough speed when you get good at it for it to be effective and if its too short, then your going to have painful welts on your forehead and on the top of your head for a while!<br /><br />I went through more than a couple waist trimmers belts unfortunately until I found the one I own now.  Many of these belts are, to be frank; crap.  They are thrown together without much effort and after you sweat in it a few times, it starts to fall apart.  I've been using the one I have now for the past 6 months, so as hard as it is to do, I think this particular belt actually changed my mind about ab trimming belts in general.  I always wear this during my cardio (i.e. running outside) and especially when I use the jump ropes.  I would not suggest wearing one while you are using the Ab Carver but for cardio and jumping rope this thing will make you sweat in the midsection and burn calories like no tomorrow.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KWIOF2Y TNT Waist Trimmer Ab Belt: Stomach Fat Burner & Toner &#x2605; Extra Wide to Cover Entire Midsection &#x2605; Uniquely Designed to Repel Sweat & Moisture w/ Anti-Slip Grid Technology &#x2605; No Slipping or Movement of Fabric! Premium Body Shaper, Slimm...]]<br /><br />I love the ab carver, adore my jump ropes, and I'm wearing my waist trimmer right now as I type this review (no kidding!)...but none of these tools would have done a darn thing to help me reach my weight loss goals if I didn't first lay the foundation with a set of healthy eating habits.  I hate the word diet, so I'll use ""healthy eating habits"".  These pieces of equipment I've mentioned will help, but if you want to really see those abs ya got to watch what eat.  And trust me I wish there was a way around this one because I love salty food but there is most certaintly not - Good luck friends!"

1680,1,N,Books,0980740711,Diana Inquest: The French Cover-Up,Justice,"This post has been slightly moderated to satisfy Amazon's rules of posting.<br />This is a smaller overview that will enable people to see more easily what the full PDF is about. It shows why there is a need for a rebuttal. Morgan attacked by book with lies as I can show. Those who then wish to proceed to the full PDF will be welcome. My web site is at PROBITYPRESS.COM.<br />JOHN MORGAN: A FRAUDSTER EXPOSED<br />IF ANYONE WISHES TO ASK QUESTIONS, OR MAKE A STATEMENT, I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO RESPOND TO YOU ALL PERSONALLY.<br />I have written a book called The Princess Diana Conspiracy that has been attacked by a fraudster called John Morgan. Morgan has written a load of rubbish about my book and said there are two hundred errors in it and then expands that onto 500. One of Morgan's team of loyal ""reviewers"", Hiram, has arbitrarily increased that number to 600. It is all an exaggerated corruption.<br />This is a logical way for MI6 to progress their campaign. But they would also like you to read Morgan's rubbish because he espouses corrupt inquest evidence and so supports their purpose. If you fall for it, then Diana will become a fading footnote of history but the monarchy will also be safe for another number of years until it finally succumbs to the inevitable but too late for Diana's justice.<br />To all those souls that demand justice for Diana I ask you to consider the points I make. It will take a little of your time but Diana will benefit from your diligence and be closer to being avenged. You will follow my logic; most will recognize the truth having read this PDF.<br />I place you on my web, just before the PDF.<br />God bless<br />Alan<br /><br />JOHN MORGAN: AN UNPLEASANT BUT NECESSARY REBUTTAL<br />INTRODUCTION<br />An unpleasant task follows; one I cannot sidestep. Someone called John Morgan from Brisbane, Australia has compiled several books about Diana over the last few years taken directly from the Diana inquest transcripts. My book is sellingwell; his aren't selling. He has attacked my book with a criminal, so called, ""review"" that is false so I must put the record straight. Morgan's books are seriously flawed but I must also illustrate his purpose in writing his odious and corrupt little so called ""review"". Here is a free PDF download. I ask that you please make the ultimate judgement.<br />OVERVIEW<br />My book, the Princess Diana Conspiracy, has sold well and convinced many people about Diana being murdered; this hasn't pleased MI6. They tried to prevent my book from reaching the US market by sending my first book shipment back to the UK. Amazon.com was also later persuaded that my book was made of ""hazardous materials""; this prevented it's availability around the time I was on four US TV shows and five US radio shows in September which was a critical time for my book's exposure. I also appeared on the Geraldo at Large show in New York and wasn't told I would be met by Imogen Lloyd Webber (MI6) who tried hard to debunk my views. Now MI6 recruit a failed author to assist them.<br />MI6 use Morgan's services because he is more concerned about money than justice for Diana. He has written several boring, disastrous books and has latched onto ""The Princess Diana Conspiracy"" to advertise them. He wrote his ""review"" based on his flawed opinions, not facts. Despite acknowledging that the inquests evidence is corrupt, he uses this same material to debunk my book and to write all of his own books; it is all he has. How anyone can write an account of what happened to Diana by using this same corrupt evidence and without challenging it, escapes me. MI6 had ten years to sanitize evidence and Morgan's views reflect the inquests findings, thus showing that he supports MI6.<br />I show that a huge number from Morgan's list of my supposed ""errors"" are either complete nonsense, his ignorance of the pre inquest evidence or his own baseless opinions. Morgan suggests his opinionsare indisputable and other ""errors"" are what he calls my ""Power Constructs""; these are where he doesn't accept the evidence I present because he doesn't possess it. All are my supposed ""errors"" and a large number of examples are shown in the PDF. Morgan didn't start looking into the details about this vile crime until 2006. I began in 2003 so I use this pre inquest evidence to challenge the evidence that emerged from the inquest. Morgan perversely extolls the inquest evidence whilst also stating it is corrupt.<br />He attacks me by saying that ""All investigative books-I include my own-have some errors. That is not the issue. The issue here is the level and type of error"". So he pins the justification for his attack not on any errors but on the level and type of my supposed errors that apparently indicate I am working with MI6 (I am not). So, if you are content that the examples I show in the PDF illustrate Morgan's point is rubbish, and you may even regard his comments as pathetic, you will clearly see his purpose.<br />This was not a labour of love but done out of necessity. If we are to have justice and bring the truth to light then I need to clarify Morgan's purpose and send him to your mercy; not of my choice. Please find the time to read the full review on my web and take your own stance. Don't let this man pervert the course of justice now when my book takes us so close. Demand justice for Diana, Princess of Wales and deny MI6 their hard fought for victory.<br />PDF FOLLOWS ON WEB<br /> (I did make mistakes in The Princess Diana Conspiracy and have apologised. But these genuine errors were corrected and published as an eBook three weeks before Morgan's corruption emerged so his pathetic comments about my MI6 association and raising false flags etc., by deliberately giving out false information, are proven untruths; he knew I was pursuing justice. I had already corrected the genuine errors earlier so clearly wasn't trying to laya false trail. Please understand this point because it's the bedrock of Morgan's excuse for his corruption and proves this man is a criminal. I have now finished a review of my entire book and it is being typeset; it will be with the printers next week and also an update will be sent for the eBook. I shall also be extra careful when I send the files to the printers this time to ensure they arrive intact-more later.)"

I really dislike the plastic tops. In my opinion the plastic leeches into my hot drinks, giving it a nasty taste. Also the silicone around the cap leaves a nasty taste on the rim of the lid.The lid doesn't smell like anything to me when it's clean / prior to use and I've diligently scrubbed it, so I can only conclude that it's poor-quality plastic that's leaching something into my cup."

These are considerably heavier than the cheapest ones. They're accurate in the wind and have a strong rebound, which is good for wall practice.<br /><br />The reason it didn't get five star is because the first ball cracked open after only about 3 hours of play.

I was a little worried that the texture of the surface (which is about the texture of the inside of an iron skillet) might hold food particles, but that hasn't really been an issue.<br /><br />My only concern is that the guidance on cleaning from the swanstone company pretty much eliminates every cleaner on the market. No bleach and no ammonia? Almost everything has at least one of these. Without either of these, you are pretty much out of choices. That said, I have found a very successful cleaning ritual. I start with  warm water/dish soap/scrubbing sponge and finish with a wipe down with a Mr Clean Magic Eraser and this seems to do a great job. I am a fan of bleach, so I do miss the sense of clean the burning odor of bleach gives, but don;t want to risk hazing up the finish.<br /><br />18 MONTH UPDATE. The finish on this sink remains flawless which I find very impressive. I have found a good cleaning routine as well. I use dish soap (e.g. Dawn) and a scrubbing sponge with very hot water most of the time. If it looks like ti needs a a little extra care, I follow that with a granite cleaner and polish. I go about 3 months between polishing and it still looks like the day I installed it."

I was pleased to see that the video wasn't boring and the people on it didn't seem like robots like most exercise videos I have tried. The music was good as well. The DVD itself was very inspirational, I just think it's more than I am ready to commit to. So, I am taking points off for that. t contains 24 exercises that work on your shoulders, abs, obliques, legs, and glutes. I have no doubt that the program works, but it has to be something you're committed to. It's not something you can do for like 5 minutes a day and end up with a dancer's body. It's a satisfying, total body workout. A friend of mine used the system and she's looking amazing. I just don't have the discipline. So, if you're dedicated, then I'm sure you will look great. If it's a half-hearted attempt then there's probably another option."

The rhinestones are stamped on, mine our on a curve. I paid over ten dollars for expedited shipping, it got held up.<br /><br />They graciously credited my account for shipping.

I got it for my little brother for his birthday, and it was a big hit with him. It's pretty easy to operate and looks realistic - he had a blast showing it off to his friends and getting confused looks before he explained what it was. It takes good quality pictures, and you can get them on the computer by using the USB cable. I think it's pretty neat that you can record with it, too. Overall a pretty good spy pen for the price; makes a great gift and would even be fun to play around with yourself."

Boy do I regret it.<br /><br />It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, the HDMI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.<br /><br />Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy!

I have to give it one star because it should work over 15 days.  The company must know there is a problem.<br /><br />You will see others that have the same problem with the headset.

While it is very sturdy the picture shows a table with six chairs (which is what we ordered) but the table is only large enough for four chairs. The table top also came with a slight ding on the top. The chairs that go with the table are beautiful and quite sturdy though.
2243,4,Y,Automotive,B004YHOB5U,Chemical Guys HOL_182 Foam Blaster Complete Car Wash Kit Foam System (8 Items),Great except the foam gun,"This was my first time using Chemical Guys products and I was pleasantly surprised. The cleaners work well and leave your car nice and squeaky clean. The citrus cleaner is the best cleaner, good for washing the car the day you plan to wax it. The gloss-works is best for cleaning a lightly soiled car, but does leave it wetter looking than the other washes. The big jug which I guess is a mix of the two runs right down the middle on cleaning power and gloss. The gloves are of good quality, particularly the microfiber glove. Those tend to fall apart or mold quickly here in Florida, but this one is still going strong.<br /><br />But the foam sprayer is of poor quality.<br />When this thing worked, it was great and I plan to buy another one, but will seek out a different brand. When I first got it, there was a missing part on the foamer (the hose/strainer that sucks up the soap). I called chemical guys directly to see if they would send me a replacement. They were very friendly and sent me one at no cost that arrived in only a few days. I was pretty impressed since I had actually purchased this through a third party vendor. The foamer worked like a champ for the first couple of months, but started leaking shortly after that. Then, the trigger started sticking so you couldn't stop the flow of foam. It became unusable within 6 months."

When I took the exam I found myself cursing the review book as a great deal of information on the exam was never mentioned in this text. I had to reach into the deep recesses of my mind (scary) to retrieve some gray/foggy/probably incorrect information to answer some of the questions. Now, I know that cramming two years of full time graduate study into so many pages isn't feasible. So, I would sugg est to future candidates to briefly (and I mean briefly) skim their graduate texts before dedicating majority of their time to this text.<br /><br />What i used to study were these 2 books:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Phlebotomy-Worktext-Procedures-Manual-2e/dp/1416000356/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1344539095&sr=8-6&keywords=Phlebotomy<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007PJF9LY"

They are ugly and tight and horrible. That doesn't mean I don't need one so I always look out for the best one there is. I hate the tightness of the swim cap above all. This is why I found this cap from swimculture and decided to try it out. I can't really go to the pool without a cap, because they put lots of chlorine in the waters. It's because so many people visit the pool I bet and many of them are ladies that would clog the whole place up with all the hair.<br /><br />I like this cap because it is very elastic at least. I still look just as ridiculous like all people wearing swim caps (like an alien), but at least I am more comfortable than most of them. My cap is totally smooth and sleek black, so it doesn't draw any attention. My ears and head didn't hurt at all after wearing my cap, so you can see that it is very elastic and nice to wear. If you absolutely have to wear a swim cap at least buy one that is comfortable like this one on this site."

There are such a large number of incredible lessons of how we ought to carry on with our life the way we are intended to live. It is a short book yet notwithstanding it being so concise, it has taught us the genuine significance of life. I truly like the thought that the writer introduces in his book of how human race is worried about their life and how each of us is in a rodent race, what he calls, throughout today's life. In the wake of perusing this book, I had the capacity carry on with my life at the fullest and understood the easily overlooked details that we have a tendency to overlook and pass up a major opportunity in our occupied routine are the genuine satisfaction of life.  My just concern in regards to this book is that it required about more human related illustrations and less creature related ones. Yet other than that, this book shows us the things you would not typically get the chance to learn. So 3 stars from me."

They pop into the walls but only on on side. She didn't seem to mind that much though. I thought it was a bit strange after I finally figured out it is one-sided holes.<br /><br />The second thing about this set that sticks out is the sink that comes with it. It is cute and the idea is great and all, but it doesn't seem to have much use. My 6-yr-old daughter plays as if it isn't there. She does like the mask that came with the Little Pet Shop set. I was surprised that it actually does stay on the pet!<br /><br />The last thing about it that I have noticed - The wall mount on the bottom right (which is small cardboard) doesn't flatten out well so you can't really sit anything on it. I am unsure why they included this small &#34;surprise&#34; instead of just including a small side table or long-standing table.<br /><br />I would still recommend this to other parents but not without telling them about these things just in case. I was a bit disappoint by this set."

The light only took 2 maybe 3 days to get here but it did not work. The box itself looks like it had taken quite a beating during shipping, so this may have lead to my light not working, I can't be sure. But the online vendor I bought it from did not respond to my requests for a refund. I eventually found the manufacturer here on amazon and just as a last ditch effort sent them a message explaining my plight. To my surprise I received a phone call from a  real live human being the next day! He was extremely congenial and apologized for my recent experience and assured me I had either received a defective unit or that it was indeed damaged on its way to me. He offered to replace it with no further questions and I was really surprised - needless to say I can't rate the headlight itself yet, but I wanted to post SOMETHING now and once I get the replacement I will update my review.

Prompt delivery. Received the watch in good condition. The watch itself looks as good as it does on the screen... a good, solid watch... sporty looks and feel. Some might think it is heavy, which it probably is, but I have no problems there. My main complain is that the manual that comes with the watch is useless... does not have specifications/ help for this particular model. Also the seconds hand is the tiny dial at the 6 O'Clock position and the main ""seconds"" dial is for the stop watch, which I find weird in a watch.<br /><br />Overall, I think it is a good buy, if you don't mind a heavy watch. I even got a pair of Nautica binoculars free!! And no one can beat Amazon's price."

I don't know why, I treated it like a baby since it's my first DSLR. Now I don't know what to do, it's already out of warranty and might be costly if I send it to Canon for repair. I had 60K actuation and it never fail me before, but know this happened and don't know what to do. I tried all known methods/tricks to give back it's power but nothing worked.<br /><br />This camera can give you the level of pixels you expect for 18MP and the fast performance when it comes to focusing. However, you should know that you also need a good lens to get sharp images, trust me. Use prime lenses. they're tact sharp. zoom lenses have sweet spots but when you use prime lens you'll get what you want!<br /><br />If you really want a DSLR that will last I think you should change your mind and get an inexpensive model instead and just invest in lenses. DSLRs have a life span and you'll regret if you spend a lot of money on a full frame or a semi pro DSLRs and after 3+ years it will be dead and unusable. I've been there, trust me."

Um, only thing that disappointed me about this watch is it did not come in a box! :( lol It was wrapped in bubble wrap. I wanted it to come in a box because I was buying it as a gift for my aunt and everyone knows I can't give her a watch without a box! It will look used. :) Anyways.. I talked with the sellers about that concern I had and they were very understanding and dealt with me very patiently, prompt and professional. So, ""Lovers2009"" are indeed excellent sellers to deal with when you have concerns.<br /><br />This all being said, the watch does NOT look cheap in anyway and is so worth the 6 bucks, it is such a steal for the look. I received it ticking and in great condition. Oh and one last thing worth mentioning if I were to use it, it did not fit on my wrist. Keep in mind your wrist size, I would say this is for women with big wrists. Sorry girls, unless you want to scoot the watch up like on your arm to let it fit. I hope my review is helpful. Thanks!

He might want to try it out himself and chokes the helpless little one from behind when mom is too busy and not watching.  I am sorry; this is a major design flaw: The overall design concept using a locking button on a baby's neck is a BIG NO-NO!! It is unsettling thinking about the potential danger. I will not be too surprised when the child safety and consumer protection agencies are knocking on the door. I will not use it. Shall I say it has ""too many strings attached"" for me to consider."

2860,4,N,Video DVD,B000NQQ4DI,Robin Hood: Season 1,"Seasons 1 and 2 really good, season 3 is fairly good","3.75 overall<br /><br />I started watching with no real knowledge of how BBC intended to interpret the legend though I guess I might have been expecting a more historically accurate look and tone (meaning darker and grittier) because that has been the trend with historical movies since Gladiator back in 2000, and you can see it now in stuff like Spartacus and Game of Thrones. Don't come to this Robin Hood series expecting that.<br /><br />In this first few episodes, the story is set up with some dark touches with the people starving, and King Richard's taxes bleeding everyone dry for the Crusades, and people facing penalties like getting their hand cut off for poaching in the Sherwood Forest. A soldier back from the Crusades has a moment of mental anguish from PTSD from his combat experiences. And Robin feels guilt when it looks like he might not be able to protect his ""peasants"" from the Sheriff. So, the serious stuff starts to get emotionally involving.<br /><br />But then there is far more of the cheesy, unbelievable archery stunts and swashbuckling. Everyone looks startlingly 21st century as in clean, scrubbed, well-fed, moussed and gelled, and fitted into the best, tailored costumes from the Props Department. Probably the most unbelievable character is the Sheriff of Nottingham, a total buffoon who mocks the heroes by making faces and mouthing their words in a snide tone like a five year-old. It is hard to believe that he has the competence to hold a position of authority and be a threat. In one scene, and I am not kidding, he rolls his eyes and says, ""Well, yippee.""<br /><br />So, is this comic satire then? Stuff that you're not emotionally involved in at all? Well, there are those serious moments I mentioned, so the tone kind of lurches back and forth, at least for me. Jonas Armstrong is a little bit lightweight as Robin Hood, but he alternates nicely between twinkly kindness and some quiet moments of stern outrage. But Richard Armitage in black leather - oh,my god - is total intimidating hotness as the Sheriff's main thug Guy de Gisbourne, and he steals every scene with his glowering eyes and gravelly voice. I may keep watching just for him.<br /><br />Overall, I think this Robin Hood series is enjoyable as a cheeky adventure meant for broad family appeal. If you get impatient with historical stories that are not historically believable, you might want to stay away.<br /><br />Edited to add: I have now watched every episode of all three seasons, and have come to a much greater appreciation of the villains who really steal the scenes. The Sheriff won me over with his hilarious lines and demeanor. Actors Keith Allen (the Sheriff) and Richard Armitage (the Sheriff's henchman Guy of Gisbourne) are so good they almost seem to be improvising with each other in scenes to add little details of personality. The character of Much remains a delight and Allan A Dale gets a terrific subplot that plays up to his lovable con man personality.<br /><br />I would give seasons 1 and 2 a four-star rating. Season 3 gives more intricate costumes to the main characters (nice). It also gives Robin a haircut to make him look more macho than mousy (still not possible) and gives Gisbourne long hair so he looks like some kind of death-metal god (I liked him better with short hair but, seriously, man, the actor is so beautiful he can rock any look). The reasons I wouldn't give season 3 four stars is the inclusion of two really annoying new characters: the shrill and brassy Kate and the pompous and pushy Friar Tuck who declaims every single one of his lines as if it is a matter of the gravest importance. Also the fact that the less-than-compelling Robin is the only actor in all the episodes of season 3. Gisborne is absent from two and the Sheriff is absent from four or five. But I loved the guy who shows up to play Prince John for three episodes as a narcissistic creep, and I also appreciated the devious and complex new character of Isabella."

It's way cheaper than another stabiliser of similar make that I've been eyeing for a while and I guess it was an impulse buy.<br /><br />In any case, there's nothing wrong with it. I spent a few weeks getting to know this Glide Gear stabiliser--I particularly enjoyed the easy release mounting plate--but in the end, it was not for me (my cameras are on the smaller and lighter side of basic, most often used is a Sony pj200 camcorder) and carrying the 5050 for teeny tiny cameras just felt and looked stupid. I ended up trading it with a friend for oddly enough another Glide Gear product (the DNA1000), which had come out later.<br /><br />So all things considered, it was still a great purchase.

Also, it would randomly shut off during use for no apparent reason. I just wasn't happy with the camera.<br /><br />I then did some research for a different model that I could be more confident buying so that I would be happy with it's performance during use. Luckily, I did find a way better camera and finally don't have to deal with the annoying issues the 70D had.

My husband has worked on all of our cars for years. He is also a mechanical engineer. When we read all the reviews about it being a tight fit, we thought those people were being dodo birds.<br /><br />We put our 2009 Acura MDX up on car ramps and my husband struggled for two hours on a Friday night before giving up. There is too much build up to install this hitch without thoroughly cleaning all the gunk off and using the tap in the bolt holes under the vehicle. We thought we would get a tap on Saturday and get it installed. ""How hard would it be to find a 14 mm tap? We live in the Seattle are so it shouldn't be a problem,"" we thought. Oh. How. Wrong. We. Were. Places like Ace Hardware and Shucks Auto do not carry a tap that large in-store. They were special orders only. After calling a few friends out of desperation, we were referred to Tacoma Screw in Seattle and they had one. Machine shops are not open in the weekends, so that's why we had trouble getting one. It took five hours to track one down.<br /><br />Once my husband used the tap on all the holes, the hitch went right on. It was still a snug fit, but he didn't have to struggle.<br /><br />We have been using the hitch for about a month now. It looks good on the car and didn't require a special bumper trim piece. We are happy with the hitch itself and have used it to attach our Yakima Holdup bike rack.<br /><br />I also recommend buying the hitch cap if ordering the hitch from Amazon. It was under four bucks and gives the hitch a more polished look when not in use.<br /><br />The hitch arrived from Amazon on a Friday instead of Monday as Amazon estimated a three days sooner than expected. It was packaged in the original Curt box. It was supported nicely in the cardboard box and the hitch was wrapped to prevent scratches. The hitch was in pristine condition.<br /><br />This hitch would have gotten 5 stars, but I feel like there should be a recommendation from the manufacturer to have the tap on hand when you start, thus only 4 stars."

After so many raving reviews, I was looking forward to putting this peeler to work in my kitchen,  But I was very disappointed when I opened the box.  The stainless steel finish on the handle was all pitted and scratched and did not look anywhere near as good as on the product photo.  But worst of all was when I tried to make zoodles.  The blade flew of the peeler on the first slice and I ended up cutting myself.  It looks like the blade was not even attached to the peeler.  This was a poorly manufactured peeler and I am left wondering why this product has so many 5 star reviews.  Into the trash it went."

The color is gorgeous, I love how they colored it up. So many compartments which is what I like most and that lock feature for the top and side part is genius. I also love how they maximise the space it have, like the side compartment for necklaces, it have this small pockets at the bottom and still have hangers. Downside was, the box I received have some flaws and I blame the Quality Control inspector here. Some of the hangers are not properly attached, they are somewhat loose. The inside compartment of one of the drawers isn't aligned properly like the others so it has this uneven area. Mirror isn't clean when I opened it, I don't know how it happened. Next time, I hope they inspect these kind of things first before sending it to their buyers."

Because the crap hardly lasts and it's a complete ripoff. ALL of these people that wrote these five star reviews must either work for HP or SMOKE CRACK IN MASSIVE AMOUNTS. No one in their right mind would say they enjoy paying $20 OR MORE for something that probably costs less than $.50 to make (probably more like $.10 even after handling costs) and that can't even print out a short novel, or heck, a children's story for that matter.<br /><br />To the reviewer that said this black ink cartridge lasts 220 pages YOU ARE A FLAT-OUT LIAR AND/OR A MORON, and neither should be writing reviews and giving untruthful info to other people. The only way this ink would last 220 pages is if each page had a single word printed on it or maybe a single sentence. Maybe even a short paragraph. But no way in hell would one of these cartridges last 220 full pages. NO WAY, NO WAY, NO F-ING WAY. I do my own personal taxes, the taxes for my parents, and taxes for my own business. I print two copies of every return, one for my records and one for sending in (I don't e-file). I printed 38 pages this year, 2014. Let me spell that out for you: T-H-I-R-T-Y E-I-G-H-T P-A-G-E-S...And that's it! The ink is GONE. R-I-P-O-F-F<br /><br />I don't know what the solution is for this BS printer and ink problem we have right now, but I know it's NOT buying these HP cartridges because they suck!"

3144,4,Y,Shoes,B000NSNQUA,"ROTHCO GI TYPE JUNGLE BOOT / 8"" - BLACK(Black-12-Wide)",Good value,I bought these boots for my job as a privet security company. I do a lot of standing and needed a boot that breathes. I am giving these boots 4/5 stars due to a very rough and hard leather sole but all you need is a nice insole and you are set. They support your feet and for my preference it's perfect it might be different for other people but I was told you want good hard support. Just having a gel sole will ware and start to hurt. With these they cup your heal comfortably and have two vent holes on the inside portion of the boots. So in short I recommend these highly and I would advise you to buy dr.sholes or somthing to that effect because the boot offers you the support in which it should and the insole you buy is just the icing on the cake.

Well some people may say that the light should be brighter, but I think it is eye-friendly especially when working in a darker rooms, it lightens the page just well enough and can be used for book reading at home or for reading dubbing lines as I do at work. In fact, the lights are just big enough and the idea that you can adjust which light and how bright you want it to be with the separate switch on button is very helpful - I use it when I want to focus on the top of the page only and dim the bottom by switching only one light in every lamp.

I really needed a new one and I though the good reviews on here would point me in the right direction. Now, I don't see how any of them are real...<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that the pictures looked no where near 16.1 MP quality. They were grainy and very low quality. At first I thought it might be the settings but it was always that way no matter what I did!<br /><br />If that wasn't bad a enough the time it took to scroll through the menu was super slow. It was painful and I dreaded having to do anything with it. I thought for the price, I would have received something better.<br /><br />I could only deal with this for so long, so I got something different after doing plenty of research. I spent hours looking for something I could be confident that I would like.<br /><br />After owning the new camera for a month I can say I have used it pretty much every day. I love it!

He is not even weary about offering a knock-off product of the highly acclaimed McPolo's BabySoft Bib, a quality product at Amazon most parents are aware of. Not only that, he just casually ""drives through all the red lights"" so to speak and ""borrows"" their product images puts on his own logo and calls them his own! Sorry it is what it is, this is stealing under broad daylight! More to that, the language he uses to describe the product is also just too obvious a copy from the originator's version, as if he does not have any imagination, enthusiasm or beliefs pushing his knock-off product, but just wants sales, sales and more sales. One more thing that I cannot swallow, and it is the final nail to the coffin: He even brave enough to ""borrows"" McPolo's customers' product reviews next door on Amazon, word-for-word and fabricates the entire customer reviews entries!! I give him a 5-star for his guts!! But I cannot stomach and condone blatant business misconduct in such a way under Amazon's nose. I wonder why they don't take actions against this seller, to be honest. Sorry, I will not buy this product at any price. Fair competition is ok, but this is just too much, too much in-your-face, unethical and it is totally un-American."

3378,1,N,Grocery,B00BG0ZJ0Y,"MatchaDNA Organic Powdered Matcha Green Tea, 10 Ounce",BEWARE of LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE MATCHA!!!,"BEWARE of LEAD CONTAMINATION IN CHINESE MATCHA!!! Last year ConsumerLab.com (a leading provider of consumer information and independent evaluations of products that affect health and nutrition) said that it is NOT ADVISABLE TO EAT or CONSUME MATCHA from China until you are sure about the purity of the matcha!!! The only way to be sure that lead is not present in Chinese matcha is to see a laboratory report on the amount of lead present in the Chinese matcha. I would like to see the actual laboratory report on lead content of matchaDNA Chinese Matcha. It should be uploaded on to the Amazon website by the matchaDNA so that we can all see the results. Once I see the laboratory report on Amazon, I will decide whether or not to drink this Chinese matcha.<br /><br />I believe that lead has been entering the River Yangtze which is one of the main rivers in China and the East China Sea due to poor industrial waste disposal regulations and practices in China. Subsequently, contaminated water gets into the agricultural soil via water irrigation systems which obtain water from the River Yangtze. From the soil, the lead enters the plants and deposits within the leaves. These same leaves are finely powdered to produce Chinese matcha. If you drink tea made from Chinese matcha, there is a real risk that you are drinking lead with the tea!<br /><br />I was happy to read that this lead contamination problem does not exist in Japan as Japan has strict industrial waste management regulations and practices. Matcha from Japan is better. Tests that have been done on matcha from Japan showed that lead in Japanese matcha was &#34;below the measurable limit&#34; :)<br /><br />The reason why we should all check the amount of lead in Chinese matcha before drinking it is that Lead can cause disease in any part of the body. Lead can damage the BRAIN (causing learning and behavioural problems), heart, intestines, kidneys, reproductive organs (lead can damage sperm and can damage the developing baby in the womb), and the bones! It is important that we see the lab report. It is a food safety issue!!"

My daughter's school orchestra teacher told us she needed to move up from her 1/2 (used) cello and I thought about the quest to find an affordable ($650) first cello for her, we actually drove hours to another state and had to puchase a bow.  If my child was a serious string player who practiced and played for the love of the instrument then I could see spending the money for the 3/4, however my child doesn't practice consistently and this isn't a full sized instrument.<br /><br />The sound isn't as good as my child's 1/2, more muffled than clear, no ringing end notes.  We replaced the strings with pro-arte brand strings and noticed enhancement in the sound.  Good, not great sound enhancement.  The E string broke while the adult &#34;helper&#34; was tuning in chamber orchestra, the pegs are stiff and tricky like most new string instruments.<br /><br />Tip, don't purchase the more expensive perlon core style (dominant) strings with this beast.<br /><br /> I then purchased the prelude strings in the red package, now we are talking.  I had forgotten my own lesson with the first cello after we had first purchased it, get the heavy duty strings that last for students (and helpers) who are still learning to tune.  The sound is brighter with the new red pack of strings, you can hear the cello, especially since most students get the cheap strings that are &#34;brighter&#34; sounding for their violins that tend to drown out the few cellos.<br /><br />The bridge is very thick and appears to be carved from a 2x4, however it gets the job done with little finesse.<br /><br />Price is the selling point for this cello.  The price is right and it is able play after easy set up.  Sound is deep and mellow.<br /><br />***I strenuously suggest getting better strings!, the ones included are more fishing line than cello strings."

3455,3,N,Video Games,B0009VXBAQ,Wii,okay console,I bought this item from a used seller and the only thing I really have to complain about was the motion controlled games aren't as fun as their cracked out to be. Was shipped in a quick timely matter!
3456,4,N,Video Games,B0053BCP40,Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon,Great sequel for 3DS.,Great sequel for 3DS. This game is a lot of fun. I had played the original when it came out for Game Cube. This takes things to the next level but still retains the feel of the classic. Recommended - especially around Halloween!

I mean, Dan Harmon may be back, but the stories aren't what they used to be. The light-hearted escapism prevalent in the past have been replaced with something very heavy-handed and trying too hard.<br /><br />The other reviewer was right. It's probably time for everyone to leave Greendale. Just wrap it up and quit while they're ahead."

I don't know if it was an issue with all the models but when ever there is an interruption in playing (like pause or stop) the screens go to sleep and the secondary has to be turned off and switched on again."

This is not a good camera. My 11 year old 2 Megapixel Canon IXUS produces much better result. This camera is only good if you are in bright daylight. Even then the pictures are so grainy. Don't be fooled by its appearance, the touch screen is useless, non responsive and non functional. Its unnecessarily complicated. Don't even think of comparing it to any APPLE touch  screen.  If you want a simple good point and shoot camera, go for CANON. I don't want to look biased but I think SONY lost its glory."

There is no way cover would hold up to one washing as the entire under side is not the plush velour fabric but a paper type net almost that you could poke a finger thru.  wow skipped on fabric no fabric on bottom of bed just mesh can you believe it.  going back now.
3487,2,N,Home Improvement,B001CK1C90,"Moen 3867 Four Function Massaging Handshower with Slide Bar, Chrome",cheap looking,The quality of the item overall is great. The rubber cover is somewhat pointless; as its just cosmetic and cheap looking. The hose that comes with this unit is very poor and from the packaging may take some time to shape normally. I'll probably pick up a better quality hose to use with the hand shower.

READ THIS BEFORE BUYING!!!!,"I got this pool hoping to have something big enough for my kids to use and have fun in, but that's not what I got. First, it was extremely complicated to setup the whole system. Once I did get it set up and started filling it, I found that it had TWO leaks, not just one but TWO. I emptied the pool and attempted to fix them but it just didn't work. Overall I just wasn't happy and felt guilty for buying it.<br /><br />I dealt with that ordeal and then did some research to find a pool that my kids would enjoy and would show up in good condition. Luckily I found a great pool here on Amazon and have never been happier with it. I am glad my kids have something to enjoy this summer and I really can't find a single thing to complain about in over a month of them using it!<br /><br />If you want a quality pool, get the same one I did here on Amazon --------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1p5nq0k<br /><br />I went ahead and got someone to set this one up for me since the other one was such a pain but it was totally worth it because my kids love it and it has no signs of a leak!"

I didn't even pay attention that closely but she did and she was fuming the whole time. She said it didn't meet her expectations in any way. As for me, I didn't really care."

By that I mean almost everything falls right out of it when it's in your purse, which makes it pretty useless. Very flimsy, too.

The first 20 minutes of the movie was unnecessary but that is just my opinion. Also, the griffons scene made it look like they could've just used that the whole time. Another thing that people might not have liked this is the fact that it only built up for the following movies.<br /><br />My suggestion for people who have not watched is to either watch it now and wait for the next movies or watch it when the next movie comes out. But for me, I suggest you guys just watch it especially if you are a LOTR fan."

As i said good, but not what i have expected for a last part of a triology.. Still got to have this one so i could complete my collection.."

Almost immediately the rubber grommet and on/off switch became ensnared and after resetting several times the grommet was removed.

I have been waiting for them for almost a week. After setting everything up, I started to play my favorite movie. However, the volume coming from the speakers was very faint. I tried to tweak the settings and also adjust the volume at my home theater receiver for the rear channels. Unfortunately, I'm still not getting enough volume from these speakers. So I ended up returning this kit and hard wired my speakers to my home theater receiver. Quite disappointed."

The user controls for the menu are not brilliant as is common with Panasonic, but overall for a decent HD 50"" TV. The sound is certainly superior to the old set. It does take a while to set up and get the picture to your liking and if you're using terrestrial channels I would suggest a good signal since the picture is not as sharp as through my cable."

Only one thing that concerns me is that I wore it all day Sat. and Sun. and when I took it off I did have some type of dark mark on my wrist so I'm hoping this won't happen all the time otherwise it'll make me think it was very cheap."
3592,4,N,Video Games,B002I0K956,PlayStation 3 - 320 GB System/PlayStation Move Bundle,excellent system,I really like the graphics on the sports champions' game. Great game to have.

He used it before we cut the hole, but refused to use it after we cut the first hole. On top of that, the hole we cut was only half the size of the first hole they have marked on the plastic and it still didn't work. The plastic itself is very flimsey."

Anything much larger or heavier and it just wants to fall forward especially when you use the magnifying glass. The weight of the glass alone almost makes it tip forward. Although the clip arms are adjustable in about any configuration known to man, that almost makes it worse. With so many possible directions to turn or move the arms, it's hard to tell what part needs tightned to prevent it from slipping."

Sadly, I wasn't able to do what I wanted and expected with it due to two main issues. First, just about 9 out of 10 shots I took, the pictures didn't focus correctly. I thought I was doing something wrong but come to find out, many people have had this same issue when I researched it online. Also, during use the camera would randomly turn off without any warning what so ever.<br /><br />After dealing with the issues I had enough and did some research to find a camera I knew I wouldn't have an issue with. Luckily, I found a great camera that I absolutely love. Every picture comes out nearly perfect and I love the way the interface is set up, much more user friendly. I haven't found a single thing to complain about in over month of using it as much as possible.<br /><br />If you want a great camera that you can count on, get the same one I did here on Amazon --------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1oapQK7<br /><br />I hope I'm able to keep others from making the same mistake I did and get the better camera in the first place!"

It's nothing like the Boxee or Apple TV, even as much as it looks like one. It loads right into the android desktop. If you've ever used an Android tablet then you're right at home. I've got mine plugged into the Ethernet. Plugged it in and it got an IP address and off to play without any problems. Takes a little getting used to if you've never used Android before. Lots of resources on the internet. Great forum on their support site. Customer support is AMAZING. They answered a ton of questions before and after I purchased it. I feel confident in buying it. It's a little glitchy here and there but I think they'll have this perfected with software updates in no time."

However the design I was not a big fan of. So when I saw this product I decided what the hell; same company and much nicer look.<br />That was a BIG MISTAKE.<br />This mask leak water slowly through the two side (until you get to about under 20 feet were the pressure pushes enough on it to make it stop leaking) On top of this I emailed the owner after he told me to and then ended up on a MAILING LIST!

With the weak cooling output, I'm surprised this is anything more than a 9K or 10K btu, it simply does not cool a room even after 12 hours of operation. It also fills up with condensation fast, be prepared to empty every 4-5 hours or it will completely stop cooling. The window kit that comes with this is a disaster. It takes a lot of effort and duct tape to keep it fixed. I wonder how many people have wasted hours installing this unit. A very poor excuse for an air conditioner. """

I had tried time and time again hoping for something that sounded great and was comfortable on my head during gaming or just casual use.<br /><br />Not only was this headset extremely uncomfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. After only a week, one side stopped working and I had to hit it to try to get it to work again. This was absolutely NOT what I expected after looking at the other good reviews.<br /><br />I searched again, asked around and finally found a headset that works now, and I love it!

I love the color and it has a lot of compartments or pockets inside that you can put inside it with different things you need. Since I am going back to school I do have a lot of things I needed to pug around in it. I also like the straps because it is very sturdy and it does not feel like cutting into my shoulders.

The only problem that i had is that the parts that go around your ear don't go completely around, they kind of sit on top of your ears and are a little bit tight.

Ha, amirite?","I purchased two of these and two of them arrived in a timely manner with more than adequate packaging. I put some Celestion Silver series speakers in there, I found that adding speakers to the cabinets really boosted the performance of them as sound enablers. Only complaint would be the hardware, the screws were too skinny for the speakers I had and the sinks for said screws were screwed on instead of sunk into the wood. Maybe there was a reason for that, I'm not a wood/screw/screw sink guy. I've used them at a couple of shows now and have wound up standing on one of them on more than one occasion because hey rock and roll I'll stay up past 10pm, I don't care. Reasonably priced and functional, plenty of speaker cable in place in addition to an easy install for the speakers (I wound up using the hardware from my old cabinet, though).<br /><br />No gypsy curses detected, so A+ in that category."

I was thrilled to find one at Target.  It ended up being such a let down....My son's spirits were as deflated as this stupid balloon.<br />I bought one at Target (for a fraction of the cost that people are asking on Amazon and eBay). I took the ball out of the box, inflated it to about 3/4 intended size, my son picked up the ball and a huge hole formed. Of course, it immediately deflated and was un-repairable. NSI (the company that makes them) includes a return envelope for popped Wubbles.  How convenient!  They include a note: &#34;Lifetime replacement warranty&#34; &#34;Do not return to the retailer.&#34; Only problem, they want $7 &#34;handling fee.&#34; Plus the cost of postage to mail it back, which ended up costing me another $5.

Among other things.<br /><br />That's a quibble, though, if the game had been super fun to play, I wouldn't have cared.  But so far (and I'm not QUITE finished with it), it's kind of a trudge.  Lot of similar mission types, lot of very loose driving, and a lot of very loose combat.  Loose is a generally good term for the game overall.<br /><br />Since it seems like this'll probably get a sequel one way or another, I'm hoping they can take all the cool fun things out of this one (THE HACKING) and polish them into something really good the next time around.

The game is fun the 1st time through.. but after that, it's boring and monotonous. Blizzard clearly showed that they were more focused on creating a Real Money Auction House than a good, enjoyable game.<br /><br />I got this game for the enjoyment of dungeon crawling, but unfortunately, this game doesn't have it. And the itemization is beyond awful. I also purchased this game in anticipation of arena/pvp. But with the induction of the RM-AH, it's essentially just going to be a ""pay2win"" form of pvp.<br /><br />One thing that was particularly painful for me was the fact that when you 1st play the game, you can only play it in Normal difficulty. Beating the game on Normal unlocks the next difficulty, and so on and so forth. This is beyond stupid and was done just to keep people logging time in the game. Normal difficulty is a joke. It's dumb that Blizzard forces you into playing it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a dungeon crawler that's actually focused on ""fun"" and ""gameplay"".. buy Torchlight 2."

3923,1,N,Video Games,B00178630A,Diablo III,"Blatant Money grab, the greed of Jay Wilson and Blizzard","First, I bought this through digital purchase on the Blizzard website, but I think getting as much negative press out there to prevent more gamers from falling for this ponzi scheme is important.<br /><br />Warning: If you purchase this game, you are willingly becoming a human node to farm profit for Blizzard. The game is designed completely around the need for the real-money auction house to compete and do well in the end-game. The difficulty curve in the final stages of the game is so absurd and the loot system is so obscenely weighted against you in terms of probabilities to actually receive an upgrade, that you have no choice but to farm for hours on end to afford to purchase upgrades from the auction house. This game could have been named: ""The World of Auctions"" and it would have at least not been as big a let down as slapping the Diablo franchise on the front of the box.<br /><br />One month into the game, Blizzard releases the real money auction house. Now the auction house that uses the in-game currency (Gold) is a barren wasteland of good loot. It's meh-mediocre at best. Anything very good to great gets slapped on the Real-money auction house for 25 bucks or more, sometimes 250 bucks. It's ridiculous. But here's where Blizzard's greed starts to shine through. They get $1 for every successful Real-money auction. So there's no incentive for them to fix their broken game experience. They'll just sit back and watch desperate people trying to squeeze an ounce of fun out of their game by spending their real income on virtual garbage. Did a champion pack with aggravating affixes just demolish you repeatedly? Why not spend 5 bucks on this amulet to improve your chances?<br /><br />Then there's the fact that the real-money auction earnings either dump directly into a blizzard balance that you have to spend in their digital store, or you can transfer it through paypal to your account. Paypal takes their cut, and I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard owns some part ofPaypal through subsidiaries.<br /><br />Soon, even the in-game currency will be available for purchase through their real-money auction house. They couldn't figure out how to make a game that the Chinese wouldn't farm and sell virtual goods in, so they just embraced it, and now they're going to get their cut at least.<br /><br />Just do yourself a favor, go play something else. This game is nothing but a money grab in a somewhat pretty looking but poorly developed gaming experience."

When I first pulled it from its packaging, I was surprised at how small it was, but I decided to follow the directions and get it set up. Then the first evening rolled around and it illuminated my entire front porch, much stronger than another outdoor light I'd been using, and the motion detection worked very well. I was amazed beyond words and I was so thrilled that first night that the next morning, I moved my previous outdoor light and put this one up instead.<br /><br />Day three rolls around and I noticed one evening when I went out that the light didn't work. (The other light died on the second day.) I thought that was odd. Then on the fourth day, I noticed that the light would come on around dusk--not unusual--and the motion detection would work as expected, but a few hours later, dead. For some strange reason, it seems the battery doesn't seem to be holding a charge, which is odd considering I live in Florida, we have no shortage of sunlight here, and this is placed in location that receives direct sunlight for nearly 10+ hours a day. I even tried cleaning off the solar panel, but still no joy. So, yeah, it still works, but only for a few hours each night and by the time it's fully dark out, it's useless.<br /><br />I've since moved my previous outdoor light back and although it's not as bright as this one, it's still going strong all night through."

4006,1,Y,Video Games,B0045ZB66I,Dragon Age Origins: Ultimate Edition - PC,"a week of disfunction, frustration, and grief due to ea drm","So you'll want something well over 50 gigs to download & install this. Quite a chunk of this ""cleans up"" after install but it comes in like the space hog it is. IMPORTANT do NOT run any files after download, get patch 1.05 and apply it before attempting to run anything. I had no problems with the Amazon side of things, and apart from some space issues the install went fine... registering the software was a bit more... problematic as the game gets tagged in Origins, EA, and Bioware social but in my case trying to launch from local shortcuts made me enter e-mail/pw for my online account then the reg code then telling me congrads w/big green play button which goes to we're sorry can't connect and that's it. For a week. Nothing. Yelled help and gave it a little time. Nada. So, after a week with no love from ea I tried something else and in literally 15min I was FINALLY able to boot the bloody thing... which I currently hold such a bad taste in my mouth over I'm gonna set her aside for now and give it a spin when I'm not so strungout over the effort to run the thing than all anticipation has turned to meh... will update when I can more fairly access gameplay.<br /><br />...<br /><br />So I start as a fantasy race female character who quickly ends up in a prima nocta situation from the human nobles, captured via cut scene, and fighting her way out of the dungeons with her cousin. This was immensely satisfying as the humans actions in slaughtering helpless companions left zero moral question to the violence and your party's toons are quickly splattered in the gore of your fallen human foes... HECK YEAH! They got their hook in me... and promptly forgot to set it as the immediate next ""interaction"" has the authorities come to arrest you and your cousin and the HUMAN there to recruit you into the Grey Wardens turns your cousin over taking only you with a stupid argument that your cousin will be safe locked up yet you'd surly be executed if you stay and anyway YOU stepped forward and told the truth (I guess the blood that covered the characters was likely to go unnoticed if I'd just kept quiet) that left me hating the main NPC. There's nothing to express contempt however, you just ""choose"" to cooperate which then results in your going to some town to meet a bunch of HUMANS shortly to be saddled with some silly task to become a Warden that you have to complete with a party of 3 other HUMANS... who you can't kill and who won't leave even when I killed some wounded guy pleading for help in cold blood right in front of them... half the time you have no option in interactions with them but polite ones which prove very frustrating for a character with every reason to hate all humans unconditionally and never, ever work with one. Oops, you can't be that character actually, forgive and forget, it's no big deal, do as your told... it's a story.<br />I don't like that story so I'm putting it down. It's too frustrating. I suppose I'll try a human noble character one day... Maybe the Grey Wardens will start looking like good guys from that perspective as whatever ""story"" is ruining the illusion of freewill that makes play interesting seems more suited to that protag type and the choices that character might make. They miss the range badly for this type with me at least.<br /><br />As far as play mechanics go it's Baldurs Gate spacebar=pause in 3d. it's a pretty thing but it has awkward moments, particularly around pinch-points like doorways, the very points most tactically useful on the maps, really amplifying the fiddly camera. This is easily overlooked in battles your interested in and not easy to overlook in mundane, filler battles where there always seems to be something more to click before the thing will move on.<br /><br />Also, by running a game accelerator that shuts down lots of background processes and setting the exe to compatability for xp sp3, as admin, disable themes, desktop, dpi I get a boot in and exit out that just crashes explorer not winblows altogether"

But all the effort in the world won't make up for a lack of vision. This game is blind to imagination and focus. Capcom's uncertainty about the series' identity post-Mikami (and post-Uncharted) is hardcoded into its structure: four campaigns offering different, flawed expressions of that potential. And the inevitable price for this wavering is a lack of coherence. Resident Evil 6 is an unwieldy tribute to the series' past, an uneven expression of its present and an unwelcome indication of its future."

4148,5,Y,Health & Personal Care,B00HN0W6F2,"Hamilton Healthcare Organic Green Coffee Bean Weight Loss Supplement, 60 Count","This Works Well, but remember there's no such thing as a magic pill","I think the reason supplements get such widely mixed reviews is that everyone is looking for a magic pill. They want to make no other changes, take a pill and want the fat to melt away. I have never heard of anything that's ever happened like this.<br /><br />Personally I was in what is considered the 'overweight' range for my height and build. Everyone said I looked great and scoffed at the idea of being 'overweight', but I kind of felt it. Clothes were getting snug and I wasn't comfortable with my own appearance. So I set out to get into the 'healthy' weight range by dropping 20 lbs. or so. I started a regular regimen of exercise and began to watch my caloric intake. After about 8 or 9 weeks I had plateaued after losing about 12-13 lbs. It was frustrating - my weight even slipped up a bit even though I continued my diet and exercise program.<br /><br />I did the research on coffee bean extract. Naturally the reviews are all over the place. I figured I didn't have a lot to lose by trying it out, so I got a bottle of this stuff. I'm through the first bottle now and the weight loss is staggering. I immediately blew through the plateau and I've dropped another 10 lbs. in 4 weeks. I've reached my goal but now I'm getting greedy. I'm wondering whether I continue losing to get to the mid-point of the 'healthy' range. I'm very close and there's still a bit of flab here and there that I'd like to see go away. I did still continue with my exercise program at the same time.<br /><br />Again, if you're looking for a magic pill move on. In my opinion, and I'm certainly no expert, these supplements only work in combination with changing the behaviors that got you overweight in the first place. This one seems to work extremely well when applied in that fashion."

The characters are as real in this story as I'm sure they are in the author's experience. Their portrayal reminded me of the characters from my own travels and the characters in my current classroom; most importantly, they evoked real emotion.<br /><br />Frustration, pride, loneliness, disappointment, and elation are feelings that I believe anyone who has traveled or taught can relate to. These are circumstances of so much good and so much unknown. While reading Abbey's story, I felt 23 again--I remembered the realization that teaching was way more then theory--I remembered feeling so hopelessly out of place in a foreign country that I wanted to disappear--I remembered the freedom that comes with embarking on an adventure--and I remembered how often the resolutions of change come throughout a lifetime.<br /><br />It's hard to graduate college and find your place in a grown up world. It's hard to move away from home. It's hard to know yourself well enough to predict where you will be at the end of every road. This book a story of teaching and partying in a small village in Taiwan, but it's really a story of friendship, patience, and the best time ever."

Broke my heart but I realized even Samsung gets bad parts now and then. It's a good TV otherwise http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0071NWYP8  I take super care of my electronics as I kept this LCD in new condition right up to its death. Three years? I told the Samsung rep on the phone. He just said it was out of warranty, so long story short I decided against another Samsung.  The vizio rep happened to be there and he pointed out that they re-vamped all the smart apps and told me of the new back-lit 12 panel led zone, which even the 2013 high tech &#34;M&#34; series didn't have. After fiddling with the contrast and temp colors I was able to get a fantastic picture.Bought it, brought it home and set it up.Wow! I was pretty impressed to find a $700 TV that can go up against a $1500 TV. And then you toss in a referbished TV for $500 and you've got yourself a deal! http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SSG0AJO  Vizio also now has a smaller front frame edge measureing 10mm. only 2 mm less than last year but it makes for an almost invisable frame. Another bonus... I had a good experience mounting it with this http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B000WYVBR0  I did a solid week of reading reviews and numerous visits to my local stores watching and adjusting several brands before deciding on a 55 inch LG or Vizio as my choices. I hated the new LG's magic remote( works like a mouse on the screen) but I also heard that the Vizio had lame apps on their smart E & the better M series.  Just last week I walked into my local &#34;S&#34; club and a guy was setting up the new 2014 E series B-2. He told me they were the first to get them.  Vizio ups the speaker wattage from 10 to 15 watts. Not mindblowing but way improved from the muffled speaker sound that is associated with most down pointed speakers that seems to be standard with most HGTV's. Bottom line I love it. Its good to see a company like Vizio upping their game with internal improvements instead of a cosmetic makeover like a lot of other companies.  Save some cash, get yourself a good as new TV! http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SSG0AJO"

5021,5,N,Books,1741797152,Lonely Planet Vietnam (Travel Guide),Vietnam and Thailand the Lonely Planet Way,"I have been wanting to go to Thailand and Vietnam for a long time, so when these Lonely Planet books, [[ASIN:1741797144 Thailand]] and [[ASIN:1741797152 Vietnam]] became available I had to get them. Lonely Planet really gets into a country in their guides. The don't fill their pages with glossy color photos, though a few would be nice, instead their pages are full of information.<br /><br />They have maps to everywhere you'd want to go in a country. They do the cities justice as well as the countryside. They do the markets and the beaches, the churches and the museums, the bike trails and the footpaths.<br /><br />I believe a trip to Thailand should include a side tour to Vietnam, at least mine is going to, so both books are a necessity to me. The book on Thailand is over 800 pages and its writers write as if they've lived there, as if they really know the country. A different group of writers have written the Vietnam book and that surprised me, because I though some of them would have worked on both books. Nevertheless, though it's 250 pages shorter than the Thailand book, the book on Vietnam is equally as well written.<br /><br />I should say that the print in these books is on the smallish side, but I suppose to make it any larger they'd have to have so many pagers that the books would be unwieldy, especially the Thailand book.<br /><br />I've always looked at Lonely Planet as catering to a different kind of clientele than Frommor's or Fodor's. Those two companies seem to cater more toward the traveler who has more to spend, who will more than likely stay in the more expensive hotels. Sure you'll find the expensive hotels in Lonely Planet as well, but you'll find a myriad of less expensive alternatives. I believe you get more information about a country from Lonely Planet and I'm looking forward to going to Thailand and Vietnam and having Lonely Planet show me the way."

5205,5,N,Beauty,B00BPBLMCS,baKblades Big Mouth Do-It-Yourself Back Hair Shaver,A Must Get Shaver,"After using this back shaver for some time now I decided to give a great demonstration on how the shaver works.  The baKblade is definitely set apart from the other back shavers for multiple reason.  First, the baKblade has a larger blade that covers so much ground when shaving you are literally done in less than a minute.  The shave actually feels great and because of the way the shaving blades are arranged it's impossible to cut your back when using the shaver.  Also, there is no need for shaving cream when dry shaving as you can see from the video the shaver doesn't take much effort to actually get the job done either.  I have recommended this shaver to many friends and family and no one has every had a negative thing to say about it.  Also, the handle is very lightweight and has an ergonomic curve to it that allows the user to reach the ""hard to reach"" areas.  Another feature of this shaver that is a huge benefit is the fact that it actually tackles longer hairs too so if you are shaving your back for the first time there's no need to use a hair trimmer or electric trimmer to trim away first.  The blade surprisingly works under any circumstance. Take a look at my video and please vote ""yes"" if you feel this video was helpful to you."

5312,5,N,Electronics,B00T56GFTA,Symphonized NRG Premium Genuine Wood In-ear Noise-isolating Headphones with Microphone (Gray),Symphonized NRG Premium Genuine Wood In-ear...,"These will not compare to a pair of $300 plus Sennheisers or DRE Sennheisers http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B008BXB76Y DRE Phones http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00E9262IE  But they are the best I've heard in the sub $100 price range. Possibly comparable to these Sennheisers Earbuds http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B001EZYMF4  As far as THESE headphones. They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00T56GFTA  Pros + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting. The microphone was connected in mono mode and hence people hear muffled voices from me.  + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable.  + Most important - the sound quality. The first impression was not great and I decided to actually return the product. But, I experimented with more good quality audio with deep bass, techno, melody, etc... The SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT. Don't expect bass from this headphone. But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase.  + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low.  + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode and not stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next.  + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones.  Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars.  Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening. You will not regret your purchase and will be happy you checked out http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00T56GFTA  I hope this review was helpful!"

Azra is a smart, funny, caustic, bedeviling, and one-of-a-kind character rarely seen in YA.<br /><br />When the silver bangle is clasped around her wrist that provides this power, it's the final straw in a lifetime fighting the inevitable servitude that this precious gift will truly entail. Azra descends from a long line of Jinn -- what we refer to as genies -- and a strong incident in her past has turned her away from magic, her Jinn heritage, and her Zar sisters. Finally unable to escape, Azra is faced with the dilemma of becoming Jinn in a world of humans who she must hide her powers from and yet live among, including the terrific and self-depreciating Henry across the street and her lifeguard crush Nate. Azra must navigate the increasingly complicated world she now inhabits, learning magic, hiding her true self from her friends, and avoiding the Afrit, who rule over the Jinn and keep the wish-granting Jinn and their mothers separated from the males. As Azra's first-person tale unfurls, the author is able to demonstrate the frustration, fear, and confusion we all faced as teenagers and journeyed toward adulthood, jockeying for position, affections, and our rightful place, all with Azra's wry sense of humor and wit, which punctuates the book throughout. The book builds momentum to an unstoppable pace, beginning with Azra's birthday, through her wish-granting, and ultimately to the incidents that bring her full circle in her journey of accepting being Jinn. Barreling to the end, you will finish demanding that book 2 be released much sooner than April 2016!<br /><br />This is a triumphant debut by an author with a particular talent for creating believable and relatable characters, accurate dialog, and terrific turns of phrase. Even if the author wasn't my wife, I would recommend the book to anyone who loves good characters, humor, and a well-executed tale."

The long neck allows the light to be in the full sun just about all day.<br /><br />This light comes without any instructions. The only thing you need to know is that the light should be turned on once by pushing a switch in a small hole on the light side (see video). I used a sewing needle to do it, but a paper clip or any other thin thing will work. The light is quite bright. I am attaching several shots of the light over the door of our barn during the day and during the night, you can see that it lights a fairly large area pretty well.<br /><br />One of the immediately noticeable things about this particular solar light was the fact that it would extend out away from a building rather than stay flush against it. This is perfect if you want to light up a walkway or need to push light slightly away from a building. I have a couple of solar lights that are motion-sensing, but so not emit a bright steady light like this one does.<br /><br />There are twelve LED lights beneath the solar panel that even give off some light during the day in a dimmed room. The pole is a generous 15-1/2&#34; long, 1/4&#34; thick, and quite sturdy. On the side with the LED lights it can be activated by pressing a pen into a small hole marked on/off. It's actually quite easy to overlook this and that I did. I had the panel charging, but because I had it facing up I didn't notice.<br /><br />The lighting is excellent and very bright. I do have another LEAGY solar light and the brilliant LED lights are ultra-bright as stated. All of the hardware is included in the package. I very much like the fact that the lighting has the ability to catch the solar rays more readily than those lights that hug the side of a building, a big plus during the winter months.<br /><br />FEATURES:<br /><br />1. Sturdy waterproof all-weather stainless steel construction<br />2. Solar-powered lights automatically turn on at dusk and off at dawn<br />3. Provide safety and security in high-traffic areas on your property<br />4. Built-in 2000mAh Battery, 12 ultra bright LED sets to light up 8 to 10 hours at night. The first 7 hours with high brightness, then change to energy saving mode to gradually reduce the brightness.<br />5. Continuous rain day: 2 - 3 days.

This drives me nuts because delivery people would leave packages any place they wanted to (we have 5 entry doors to our home) and I felt like I was playing a scavenger game hunt...find the package.<br /><br />My husband decided to construct a large wooden package drop off box half way down our driveway. It is very nicely built with the word &#34;packages&#34; in big black bold letters on it. However, there was still no way of knowing when packages were dropped in it. In comes the Sado Tech Wireless PIR  Motion Sensor!<br /><br />Upon receipt I read the instructions and followed how to pair my Transmitter and Remote to the Receiver. It was super easy and I didn't even need to read the instructions that were included, Waved my hand across the Transmitter and it came to life. It has 50 different tones to choose from. Thank you so much Sado Tech now I can feel safe and hear my packages when they come."

My DSLR is already heavy enough and I don't need another heavy monitor in my backpack. It plays in full 1080p, and the aluminum cover design protects the screen while I transport it from location to location.<br /><br />As you could probably tell, I use this monitor as a second screen for my DSLR. I have the Canon 5D2, and I've always wanted to buy one of those DSLR monitors to look at a bigger screen when filming. But of course, DSLR monitors are pretty expensive- and this is where I found GeChic 1303H. So far I'm loving it- there aren't any other portable monitors out there that have HDMI and VGA. This is probably the only brand out there. It's reasonably priced- other DSLR monitors are more than 500+.<br /><br />I took it out for filming yesterday and everything was great- I had to use a battery pack to power the monitor. The USB power cable is dual USB- so I had to use two battery packs to power the monitor. Actually one is enough, but sometimes the power supply isn't enough so it is better to use two.<br /><br />Note to other DSLR users out there: I had to use an additional adapter to connect the monitor to my camera. Mini HDMI to HDMI adapter. But I had one already so that wasn't a problem. Just a heads up for the others out there!"

After tons of research, watching videos, reading reviews, and checking consumer sites I decided to buy Oternal electric no bark collar.This collar is such a miracle worker. Pnut doesn't even bark anymore unless she wants to communicate with other dogs when we go on our walks and hikes. I still put the collar on her when I leave the dorm apartment just in case but it really is just a training tool.this collar is just amazing. It's worth the money investment. I barely use it and the battery is still full after 3 weeks. I would recommend this collar for anyone who wants to keep their dog. This is the miracle collar and works great even on small dogs like my pnut she is a pomchi  weighs about 8 lbs. The collar isn't too heavy for her. She is able to eat, drink, jump on her bed, and function with it on when I'm not home.

It honestly has given me a more high-level, high-ground perspective on the entire industry (especially the investors and developers). I love the step-by-step guide in both the distinctly separated investors and developers section. I thought that was very helpful in separating the roles of the two bigger players in the industry.<br /><br />There is just too much information about EB-5 floating around, specifically biased articles from the media. This book was able to give me a clear-headed idea of exactly how I should approach the people within the industry and how to explain it to those who are interested in entering the industry. EB-5 is definitely a complex industry and it's not something that is easy to just dive into. I believe the book was a great starting point for myself."

The fact that you are alive today makes you special having fought your way into human existence before conception. Even when we seem weaker than the rest, we can still rise up above the challenge and live our lives to the fullest by taking advantage of our situation in life. It doesn't matter whether we seem successful or not. Real success come from knowing our real value as a human being, that infinity we contain within our souls.

It works well with this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008G8G8Y?tag=i60-20  I had originally been turned on to these pens when I had come across an article showing that these Sakura pens had the best chemical, heat, and moisture resistance.  Found here: [...]  Ink stability is tantamount in a notebook for company or personal use. I can write with confidence knowing that my writing won't smear or fade and possibly lead me in a touchy legal situation.  I also really like the fact that the caps STAY on the opposite ends when writing, unlike some pens which don't positively lock on and fall off, eventually being lost.  My only gripe is that I'm often afraid of bending the tips of the smaller diameter pens.  I use these pens at work in labs to document my findings and observations, as well as to draw any intellectual property that may be used in legal disputes. REMEMBER, your word is only as good as your documentation, engineers!  Side note: A lot of the people who use the pens are incorrectly describing the sizes. The pen designation is a #005 and not it's diameter, not .005in, or 0.005mm. That #005 is 0.20mm in diameter, the &#34;&#34;#&#34;&#34; does not directly correlate to the pen diameter."

He told me it would not produce a lot of messy dust in the copier/printer as other papers do. I have been using it ever since. I have always liked the 5-ream pack-see GP Copy & Print Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches Letter Size, 92 Bright White, 20 Lb, 5 Reams/Carton (2500 Sheets). It's convenient, but was not available this time with &#34;&#34;Amazon Prime&#34;&#34; shipping. In fact, the price was much higher (not being sold by Amazon). So, I saw these 3-ream cartons with &#34;&#34;Prime.&#34;&#34; Like the 5-ream, these are easy to carry, compared to the bigger boxes of ten reams. I have always found the price to be one of the best bargains. It looks like Amazon is going to keep it like that. One of my main complaints about having paper like this delivered is that they so often come &#34;&#34;beat-up!&#34;&#34; Then, you have to go through the whole process of returning it. What a pain! I think we all hate that! Right? What's the use? Not this time! These came from the manufacturer in a thicker than normal cardboard box which seemed to resist shipping damage. Hopefully, this is where I will buy all my paper in the future.<br /><br />Update: 4/5/2014 -- Almost a year later, this is where I have bought most of my paper since. I am extremely satisfied with this paper, the size of the box, the convenience, the packing (if you buy more than one box), basically everything! And, in all this time I have not had a &#34;&#34;beat-up&#34;&#34; box of paper delivered.<br /><br />Update: 8/27/2014 -- I have tried other deals on the 10-Ream Cartons GP Spectrum Premium Multi Use Paper, 8.5 x 11 Inches Letter Size, 92 Bright White, 10 Reams/Carton (5000 Sheets) that occasionally appear, but each time the office staff has asked that we go back to using this economical, very convenient and easy to handle 3-Ream Pack.<br /><br />Update: 2/18/2015 -- I tried GP Spectrum¬Æ 96 Multipurpose Paper at a good price. Still, I keep coming back to this best of all bargains in copy paper."

I am very happy with them. I contacted the seller as I want more colors, so every kid in the family and my wife can use a different color on their bike.

6509,5,Y,Office Products,B00EIOT3CK,ChalkSeries Chalkboard Contact Paper Roll With 5 Colored Chalks & 1 Chalk Pen,A Few Cuts Above the Rest! Highly Recommended!,"I was skeptical when I purchased this Chalkseries Chalkboard contact paper because I have already bought my fair share of disappointing generic chalkboard contact papers- the thin flimsy ones that don't hold chalk nearly as well as they are supposed to. However, I decided to take a chance with this one although it is more pricey than the generic  Con-Tact brand.<br /><br />As almost always with FBA, the items arrived within 3 days. The retail box looks amazing-  the company definitely put some great thought into it.<br /><br />I cut an 18 inches x 2 feet portion and applied this on my bedroom wall. I instantly realized that this chalkboard contact paper is different from the rest- it has a much thicker material (which later on I will find to be the main reason why this product is superior). I was able to apply it perfectly without leaving any air bubbles trapped underneath.<br /><br />After using this for 2 days, there are a few things I can comment on in detail.<br /><br />1. It holds chalk EXTREMELY well and when you erase with a dry cloth, almost all the chalk marks are removed. NONE of the chalkboard contact papers I have previously used comes close to the quality of this product.<br /><br />2. No ""scratch"" marks are left behind even when you do write hard.<br /><br />3. If you want to ""reset"" the chalkboard, wipe it with a damp cloth, and your chalkboard will look absolutely brand new. Not a single smudge will be left behind.<br /><br />In conclusion, I admit that it's obvious that I have nothing but praises for this product. I would give this product a 9.5 out of 10, only because I wish it was as cheap as the generic contact papers out there! But I guess it is true that you get what you pay for. When all is said and done, this product is DEFINITELY worth buying if you are fed up with chalkboard contact papers that are mediocre!"

You also have an outstanding ambient mic on the front for great natural sound. The video cameras I work with all have built in XLR inputs - but DSLR's don't. This is a way to really make your DSLR a video camera too. I use this on a Sony A99 camera and it is great!

6566,5,N,Sports,B0007IS74G,AB WHEEL,Ab Wheel - Highly Recommend,"I would certainly recommend this to those looking to lose weight or those looking to tone their core. Quite simply it works! I can tell you that this ab wheel is a good price compared to those in store models and its good quality, I have had no issues with it despite tons of use.<br /><br />I've been trying to lose weight for six months now and have made pretty good progress. As with any weight loss program it all comes down to eating right, exercising and supplements. Ive never been good at going to the gym so I decided to buy products like this so I can easily workout at my house. So my routine includes pullups, resistance band exercises, pushups and cardio. The cardio helps me to get in shape and burn fat, I usually do some sprints/intervals or some longer distance running. the exercise bands, pushups and pullups help to build muscle and define the muscle. And then the ab wheel helps with my core, keeping a strong core is very important in running as well as just normal day life. I work at a desk so ad exercises help a ton with keeping good posture in a very sedentary job. The ab wheel is NOT easy, I know some people may see it and think they wont get a workout but if you do it right and keep good form you will most certainly feel it. After the first few times using it I was sore for the next day! NOT easy. But if you want results thats what you need.<br /><br />On top of my current workout needs i have also been eating healthy. This healthy eating is mainly towards losing weight so thats the focus of many of my habits. For instance upon waking up I drink a protein shake and eat a banana for breakfast, protein is great in the morning when you are trying to lose weight. 30g within 30 min of waking up is ideal. In total I stick to about 2200 calories a day and try and stay away from processed foods although sometimes it is tough. I also take a supplement called [[ASIN:B00GA200WU Raspberry Ketones ]] which help you lose more weight by burning more fat and raising your metabolism. That combined with the protein shake in the morning help a ton. The protein also has the effect of keeping you fuller longer which helps me make it to lunch time without craving snacks."

6602,5,N,Camera,B00JGZQ17Q,Channel Master DVR+ Bundle - subscription free digital video recorder with web features and channel guide (CM7500BDL2),Read this before you purchase an antenna DVR,"I am giving this DVR 5 stars simply because it does what it is supposed to do reliably.  I have tried almost every DVR that claims to do the same thing.  Let me tell you, the only other one on the market that comes close is the TiVo.  In fact, the TiVo is a better choice If you are looking for more features/bells and whistles and don't mind paying the monthly fee.  I also own a TiVo and to be honest, I like it better primarily because it has Netflix, but I think the DVR+ is a better overall performing unit and would choose it over TiVo and that's why I bought this one because I'm not interest in paying 14 bucks a month to have access to Netflix.  My Roku box does that just fine.<br /><br />I have owned it for several months now and day in and day out it does what it is supposed to do just like I was used to with my old satellite DVR.  The features are on par with most cable or satellite DVR experiences.  If you have ever used one of those this works just the same except for one feature.  This unit lacks the ability to omit repeats in series recordings.  I was told by Channel Master that this was designed this way because if you are not connected to the internet then the box does not receive the information from the broadcaster if it is new or a repeat.  They told me they had a lot of requests for this and looking into adding this capability for those users who are connected to the internet.  The only other thing I would complain about is the remote control.  It is not comfortable In the hand as most cable/satellite remotes because it is thin and the DVR playback buttons are on the bottom of the remote making it a two hand process to jump commercials.  This is not a deal breaker though, you get use to it.  And if you can't get use to it, a universal remote is always an option.<br /><br />If you own an antenna and want a DVR that works like the one you use to have with cable or satellite, the DVR+ is the best bang for the buck.  The other units on the market just don't stack up the same.  Some do not include a remote and require a tablet to control (cumbersome!), others only have a single tuner so you can only record one show at a time, none have an on-screen guide as robust as the DVR+ without paying a fee and last but not least they are not near as simple to use, at least the several different units I have tried.<br /><br />I forgot to mention that I have already had two software updates in the few months that I have owned it. (Yay!  They are making it better).  Plus I have been told that the have a whole slew of internet content coming later this year.(Will see if that pans out)<br /><br />If you want a reliable antenna DVR without monthly fee's, this is the one to buy.  Don't waste your money on others like I did, spend a little extra dough and buy this one.  In the Antenna DVR department, you truly do get what you pay for."

So, when we were offered the opportunity to try this Bluetooth Speaker with LCD Display I was excited - but I was not sure that it would be any different from the others we have used.<br /><br />I took the speaker out of the box immediately after receiving it - and I have to say that I was very impressed with its overall look. It's very modern, sleek and sophisticated looking. Plus, the weird waterproof velvety texture is fun and feels nice. I love the bright blue LCD screen - it makes it super easy to see what channel you are on - or which controls you are using.<br /><br />I also loved that unlike so many other devices of this variety - this bluetooth speaker has it's own charger - it does NOT run off of batteries! It has a USB style charger that plugs into the wall or your computer. It charges quickly and the charge lasts a long time. No more having to buy batteries every week. You will get back the cost of this speaker just in the lack of having to buy batteries.<br /><br />The speaker is really simple to use - my phone found it easily - and, after the first time - they are now friends! My phone and the speaker find each other instantly - no lag time. The sound quality is amazing. This is probably one of the larger waterproof shower style speakers that I have owned - and it definitely has a lot of oomph to it. The speaker itself has its own volume and also responds to the media level on your phone. That can take a little getting used to - but it's pretty simple. Overall, I am in love with this speaker. We use it every day - it suctions to a wide variety of surfaces 0 si we can use it all around the house. I really wish it came in more bright, fun colors - but other than that I am super satisfied with my purchase. I would definitely buy this again."

It will go only as fast as you pedal so she likes how she can take it slow while watching tv, to improve circulation in her legs.  However, if you are a young healthy person looking for a cardio workout in confined space / on the cheap, this is also very effective. Although of course not as effective at burning calories as running outside, if this is what you have to work with, it's doable.  As a note, if you are using this for serious cardio (30+ minutes), I highly suggest buying some ankle weights (3-5 lbs per leg) and wearing them while you pedal - it makes it around twice as hard and is very effective. I bought some weights on amazon with the free shipping option for less than ten dollars."

They have a handy clip on the side to take off and put back on quickly which saves the fiddling with the sunglasses arms every time.<br /><br />Anyway, once on they are pretty comfortable and to be honest hardly noticeable. The most important thing is that they float if they fall off into water and can easily be seen from a long way off. Anyway, really pleased with mine."

We hung our high. The stickers you get here are a nice touch.  http://fave.co/1bL2PyO  The only thing I would add to these is a battery for a red LED light. I had a camera as a kid that had 2 AA batteries that actually moved when it sensed motion... battery lasted over a year. I also recommend drilling a hole in the base of the mount, to feed the fake cord through on these, to make it look like the cord is being wired into the house. The fake cord as packaged (at least in mine) was just hanging off the camera.  My mom lives in a pretty small neighboorhood, though it is close to a few highschools. Every year when school gets out it seems like the neighborhoods around there get small break-ins, nothing major. Her house had her window broken into, stole small amount of money and that's it. I purchased these for her to place around the outside of her house, and the back garage.  She got this one first   http://fave.co/1bL2ufF  I got a set of these a few months ago and they are great. I came back to order more but they have changed the design! The older ones were actual casings from real cameras. This new design looks incredibly fake and too &#34;plasticky&#34;. Also, how many real cameras have the cheesy flashing red light? Almost none. If you do buy these, at least don't put in batteries for the light to flash...that's a dead giveaway that they are fake cameras. Unfortunately I will have to find another brand that isn't so obviously fake.  Side note...a little trick I like to do is to label my FOUR cameras 1, 4, 7, 9 etc...if someone is sniffing around and they can only find four, they will expect that the others have to be somewhere that they can't find."

The original rollers were nylon but did not have any bearings. The repair technician showed me the easiest way to replace them. Take a vise grip plier and bend out the metal side track about 2 inches after the curve from vertical to horizontal.  Which is sold by Sanford and Son Overhead Doors too. The only difference is that these are sealed bearings.  For the bottom roller, bend out a section of track 6 inches before the bend from vertical to horizontal. Align the bottom roller to the open section of the track pop out the roller and replace it. Bend back the track.  Align one of the rollers and use a large screwdriver between the track and side of the roller to pop the roller out of the track. Of course you will have to hold up the section of the garage door. Replace the old roller and pop in the new roller into the track. Repeat for the rest of the rollers except for the bottom roller. Use the plier and bend back the track.

7725,5,N,Home Entertainment,B00TTVMFCC,Sharp LC-40LE653U 40-Inch 1080p 60Hz Smart LED TV (2015 Model),Samsung makes great TV's that surpass every other manufacturer in their class,"Sharp makes great TV's that surpass every other manufacturer in their class. I have two Samsung's in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful. This TV has an LED screen and in my opinion this the way to go (LED is similar to LCD its back-lit better so that they are no dark spots on the screen).  Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold. TV's of this class have never been cheaper.  One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.   Additionally I found this mount to be very helpful http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00K69M0TY  The next step to take into consideration is features. Here are a few that come with this TV:  This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.  With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV. Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. Browse the web while you watch movies and TV shows, and enjoy TV while you chat with friends and family online, all on one screen with this Samsung.  As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs. This TV comes with 4 HDMI Audio/Video In, 1 Ethernet LAN In/Out, 1 RCA Component Audio/Video In amd 1 Digital Coaxial Audio Out.  Next thing when shopping for a TV is in box technology. Here are some of the features of thisTV:  Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have."

You may not be able to use this vest for take off and landing, but during the flight it is GREAT to be able to secure your baby. Especially if you are doing a long flight and you want to sleep yourself. Then you put on the vest on your baby, and then you attach it to your belt and you know that your baby can not fall down and in case of sudden turbulence he will not fall out (or up). That's how I have been using it anyway. It feels very safe to have my baby sleep with the vest on and then attached to me. If you fly with your baby in the lap, this is the only way to be able to be a little bit ""hands free"" during the flight, and know that your baby is safe.<br /><br />So far I have never been told I can't use this item on any airline."

This oil adds extraordinary flavor to anything you put it on and trust me, you're going to want to put it on everything!

I can hear the chickens both when they are in their coop and when I let them out into their fenced-in yard (which was my original intent in buying the monitors, because of hawks and other predators). Now I can relax, because I can hear if they become distressed and can run out to chase off any predators. I keep one receiver in the kitchen and one in the bedroom, so I can hear wherever I am in the house. I found that I just enjoy listening to the chickens cluck and cackle to one another throughout the day. The &#34;talk&#34; feature also comes in handy when my husband and I are doing chores, as we can communicate between the coop and the house. The transmitter needs to be plugged in at all times, but it has a nice long cord that enables me to hang it at a convenient location.

8428,5,N,Video Games,B000HMHDCO,PSP Max Media Pro,not useless at all !!!!!!,"honestly i don't know what is the problem with the negative reviews for this product because it really works, and probably they just didn't know how to use it the right way, but for my PSP is fantastic and i know that there is other ways to transfer music to my PSP but truthfully it takes a lot of time to transfer them and with the help of the PSP Max Media Pro is very easy now.<br /><br />the stuff i have transferred from my computer to my PSP is exactly the same as i have it on my computer, the quality doesn't change. this should be pretty easy to use if you are familiarized with computers and music downloads and all that stuff, if you think it will not be easy for you trust me that it will. all you have to do is follow the directions given to you in the manual.<br /><br />one of the cons is that you definitely cannot transfer movies from DVD, and is understandable because you should have the movie saved in the hard drive of your computer in order to transfer it to your PSP.<br /><br />highly recommended product!"

8503,5,N,Grocery,B000JWGFQC,Dixie Carb Counters Blueberry Cream Muffin Mix,Maybe my sinuses are flared up worse than I realize,"Okay. I was extremely skeptical of these little water-filled baggies of &#34;&#34;fake noodles&#34;&#34;.<br /><br />You should totally check this out:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00BTMDALO/<br /><br /> I had read horror stories about the fishy odor and rubbery texture. As a low-carb junkie, I REALLY missed the sauces and meals associated with pasta. Enter the Miracle Noodle.<br /><br />Here's what I feel should be addressed:<br /><br />- THE SMELL. Maybe my sinuses are flared up worse than I realize, or maybe I'm at a genetic disadvantage with a lowered sense of smell. But whatever the case, I did NOT find the smell oh-so-offensive as others have described. I actually braced myself as I cut the pouch open the first time -- ready for the worst -- but I didn't smell anything until I literally put my nose an inch above the open bag. And I'd describe the smell as more of a &#34;&#34;brine&#34;&#34; than a &#34;&#34;fish&#34;&#34; odor. C'mon guys, it's not bad.<br /><br />- THE TEXTURE. I've found that the texture varies greatly on the preparation of the noodles. My first time eating them, I was rushed and starving... so I ate them straight out of the microwave tossed in pesto sauce. Not so great -- they were definitely rubbery this time. BUUUT, the SECOND time I prepared them, I made a creamy based sauce (melted 1 oz. cream cheese, 1 Tbs heavy cream, and 2 tsp. coconut oil, topped with some curry powder) and LET IT SIT for 2-3 minutes after preparing the dish. This way the sauce reeeally soaked into the noodles and gave them a softer and less-rubbery texture. Oh, and I just nuked them in the microwave this time, too. THIS time was good. Definitely a more &#34;&#34;noodle-like&#34;&#34; texture. I ate every last noodle!<br /><br />Also, some tips I've read are to microwave the noodles twice PRIOR to preparing them. By this, I mean: Open bag, rinse in warm water, microwave 2 minutes, rinse again, microwave for another 2 minutes, rinse one last time. At thispoint they're ready to prepare as desired.<br /><br />I'm pleased with my purchase, and I'd recommend these to people watching their glucose levels or anybody wanting a zero-carb option."

Best used with the (as seen in the picture)   http://fave.co/1bKRVJA  The fastener included on the pad is enough to keep you safe from any possible worry of movement. You just need to make sure that you place the fastener on the top side of your bra instead of on the bottom (I tried both). You can't even feel them on after the first day of adjusting... but the only thing I will say as a con is that you should be weary of what bra you use with them. I am using an all cloth, no shape/padding/wire nursing bra and 5 - 10% of the time you can see the bunched sides of the circular pad under the shirt. I think if I had a bra with more shaping to it, the pads would never show through.  I purchased 120 packs and still have yet to use half - and I'm in the third week post C-section delivery. I recommend these to anyone I know who is breastfeeding, pregnant, or looking for an answer for milk leaks. I have yet to experience a leak, or embarrassment, and I wear these every day and night. Also worth mentioning - they do stay in place. I haven't worried about these moving around at all.

The price was great, although I really do not believe the original price being that hig. I think that some of the watches on Amazon might be older models, but who cares when you get a watch that looks great and is cheap enough and works great also.  Stuhrling watches are noted for their large size and this is one is fairly big. The three bands are a great extra and easy to replace. The watch has a stunning dial face design."

A great story of scheming and vengeance coupled with historical facts. It has blood and gore which is rarely shown in any series out there today. There is also nudity, there is nothing else you can ask for!<br /><br />The best thing about the series is that they keep on improving their effects. In first season, you could clearly see the fake blood but now, I keep on thinking, how do they do it? It's just that good.<br /><br />There is no series close to what Spartacus has brought into the table. The closest is probably Game of Thrones but Spartacus was the first so you might say it just copied the way Spartacus was going."

It is exactly the same height as my IKEA couch and is sturdy especially because of the lower shelf. It has no drawers and the shelf cannot be moved so it may not meet everyone's expectations.

So I figured I would buy a jump pack for myself.<br /><br />The largest engine I can remember starting was a 3.0L that was in a passat that had a drained battery. So for occasionally starting most vehicles, this will do just fine. Though starting vehicles in the winter is more difficult I imagine it'll still be able to start the same ones it can now, though I'll try to update this review during the winter."

I grew up reading comic books, as a kid the campiness worked, the PG feeling made sense. I still love comic books and comic book movies, but I no longer want the camp and the tackiness that comes with them.

Bad guys, killers, psychos going into an Asylum, you have to expect hard language, sexuality and violence, and the movie delivers. I hope DC continues this pattern."

9317,5,Y,Home Entertainment,B0079KZZKO,Samsung WIS12ABGNX LinkStick Wireless LAN Adapter,Works great!,"Though I am disappointed at the fact that Samsung would not provide this with such an expensive TV that we purchased, the product in and of itself works great. It's a simply set up process, the range is good (it is probably over 40 ft away from the router), and it has had no hiccups so far. We didn't have enough space around the TV to put an Apple TV or a Wii, so this works great to stream directly onto the TV. Going in at the back, it is not even visible from the front. Completely unobtrusive!"

The Multipurpose Laser Level Horizon Vertical Metric Rulers are worth the price. This product can be used for up to 8 feet, standard and adjustable. It gives accuracy due to the laser light beam. This feature reduce parallax errors and that gives it more advantage over similar product which never consider this factor. The fact that it gives my horizontal and vertical measurements perfect alignments, I recommend it to anyone. Handling it is simple and the black color is preferably as it does not fade easily. For the additional batteries included, thank a lot for that. They are the long lasting type and it seems that I will not be buying others soon. After successful purchasing and using this tool, I think I will order several of them and resell at my workshop. I think my customers will not be disappointed as I have tested all its aspects."

9330,5,N,Home Entertainment,B00XIIZ02E,Oven Glove - 540¬∞f Extreme Heat Resistant - 1 Single Premium Thick but Light-...,The Best Gloves I've Ever Had,"I bought these gloves to use while I was seasoning my cast iron skillet.  Handling cast iron after 15 minutes at 200 degrees: - No perceived sensation of heat through the gloves while maintain a constant grip for about 2 minutes  Handling cast iron after 2 hours at 400 degrees: - No perceived sensation of heat at first contact between gloved hand and iron handle - Sensation of heat with no discomfort first perceived after a 15 seconds with a constant grip  After two hours at 400 degrees, I picked up the very hot cast iron skillet expecting to feel some heat through the gloves but I felt nothing. I was so impressed I kept my grip on the hot iron handle to see how much longer before I felt anything. I began to notice the sensation of heat at about 15 to 20 seconds. I did not maintain my grip after that and set the pan down. I didn't think it wise to maintain prolonged contact with such a hot piece of iron regardless of how effective of a heat protectant this glove may be. I noticed some heat but absolutely no discomfort. I highly recommend this product."

The campaign (if you even want to call it that) leaves a lot to be desired, but the multi-player, which this game was truly made for, makes up for it.  There are only 6 maps (9 in total after buying DLC) but they are big enough it doesn't get stale too quickly.

9401,5,N,Home Entertainment,B00TKOSUFY,Samsung BD-J5100 Curved Blu-ray Player (2015 Model),Great,"I highly recommend grabbing the http://fave.co/1bKQtXx  Being that I only really purchase Samsung televisions, picking the brand of blu-ray player was simple. I also have Amazon Prime (which I strongly suggest purchasing) and this was eligible for free shipping which was a convincing factor.  I picked up some of these since my TV didn't have any. http://fave.co/1c3wkNc  The player itself is incredibly lightweight. The top of the player has a small touchpad that allows you to control the player easily in-case you lose the remote. The remote is standard as far as Samsung products go. If you're unfamiliar with Samsung electronics: all remotes works for all products. That means this remote works for my television as well as the blu-ray player. And, indeed, this was the case.  Next, I set up my Netflix account to be associated with the player. It didn't provide me with an access code and instead had me log in with my email and password. Fine with me; saved me the trouble of opening my laptop and whatnot. It will keep you logged in until you decide to log yourself out; this includes shutting the player off. Netflix was very responsive and I have zero issues with it still. It also has Hulu and Pandora on it but I don't use those often so I didn't bother checking them out.  I turned it on and decided to choose the quick-start option, which allows for the player to remain in an active sleep state when not in use. When you're ready to use the player, it turns on immediately. When I say immediately, I really mean immediately. There is virtually no delay when pressing the power button on the remote for the player. I've used products with quick-start options in the past and none were as responsive as this.   Overall for the price, this player is easily the best on the market right now. My one complaint is that it doesn't have wifi. I had to hard wire it into the router but we keep it next to the television anyway so this was a non-issue. Still, it's a little strange that it wouldn't have wifi being that this is the most recent model of *this* Samsung product. It's the year 2014; we have dedicated wifi in airport bathrooms. Why isn't this blu-ray player equipped properly?"

However, once I connected it to my network it did find some media on my desktop and I could stream it without even trying to. It had no issues streaming HD rips (10gb or so) via its connection.  I haven't had a single issue with any discs I've put into it. The interface is simple and functional, perhaps not the prettiest, but I could care less. Blurays look fantastic, the color really pops and the movies are crisp. It outputs 1080p/24p which my F8500 handles wonderfully. Completely smooth.  I do have one complaint, but I won't take off a star since the whole industry does this: For those of us with receivers and audio gear, keeping gear the same width and stackable has huge advantages, this unit replaced a full width Marantz DVD player, and its 7 inches smaller. Please bring back this style and not just at your top tier, the 7200 that has the audio gear case offers no benefits over the 6500 for $100 more.  I hope this review was helpful!"

I played Rogue first, and then Force Unleashed, I found this on Amazon for $30 near the end of December and assumed most of the glitches were fixed by then.<br /><br />I am about 68% of the way through the game and it is awesome!  The multi-player missions give excellent rewards and the que is never long on the playstation network.  There is a ton of missions all over the map and the companion app adds to the experience.  The battle system takes some getting use to, but after you've played for a while you'll be able to take on 3-4 guys at a time, as long as there aren't any snipers around :P<br /><br />If you are a fan of the whole assassin's creed franchise, you will enjoy this game.  If you came in late, say around ac 3 or 4?  It may not be as fun for you due to the lack of crazy naval battles and a throwback to the ground level exploration of ac1 through ac revalations."

It is so easy for her to pick and play and once the she is done, she can place it securely back on the stand.  It's discreet enough (more or less with a big guitar on it) that her parents are not complaining.  I have seen her easily close up the stand and carry it with her outside and to other parts of the house.  She says she really likes how convenient and portable it is.

Otherwise, You will end up hating it and will not even 10% of it's features/services.<br /><br />After adding my Google account, all my Android apps were there ready to be downloaded. I found the device UI fairly simple and streamlined. They use a simple set of &#34;rows&#34; broken down into several categories (Favorites, Video, Music, etc.) All the rows can be easily edited to add additional app icons to them.<br /><br />No issues streaming content and the box works great. The graphics are even better than expected. As this will not be used much for gaming, my main concern was mostly for streaming media. So far I have tested Netflix, Hulu, Play Music, Play Movies. All of which work without issue.<br /><br />It is rich with lots of free streaming add-ins. So, I have already cancelled my cable service.<br /><br />The 16GB internal storage is well enough to install apps without having to always worry about running out of space.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with my purchase, and as I get into more streaming (from home network) and start getting more into the ins and outs of Kodi, I will learn more and find out good features of this device and update more into this review.

And it fits right with my http://fave.co/1bA3TFH  I had only saw the http://fave.co/1bPOFNv in person but I thought for the price and w/ the DW brand behind it the 3500 would be &#34;beefier&#34; looking than it is. The tube diameters are the same as most entry level hi-hat stands. It looks a little diminutive. In my opinion it has a jazz or bebop kit look if that makes sense. Nonetheless seems solid enough and the overall function is really nice.  The pedal action is buttery smooth, tension adjustment is nice, really like the design of the bottom cymbal angle adjuster (no probs. w/ it backing out, all metal, and it's easy to get to), 15&#34; upper rod leaves space for tight overhead clearance and has a &#34;clean&#34; look, no problems w/ the stand staying put despite having a small foot print behind the kit and the locking clutch is a nice touch especially for &#34;harder&#34; players."

I was very impressed with the lining that has an egg crate type for rubber lining to help pad the laptop very nicely.  There is also a little extra wiggle room to slide the computer in very easily without extra stretching or squeezing to try to get it in bag. Top quality stitching at the seams that looks like it will be very durable for a long time of use. Great price too. We bought one of each of our kids for their laptops at the same price and this cover was by far a much better quality!

9980,5,Y,Luggage,B001CZL7LI,"Travelon One Size Fits Most Leather Money Belt, Black, One Size",First Test of my New Hidden Money Belt,"I just now got this thing in the mail.<br />Cutting off the extra length to adjust it to my waist size was easy.<br />Using the attachable buckle was easy.<br /><br />The outside black part is real leather as is the inside. I had another belt like this that<br />wore out quickly because the outside black was not real leather even though<br />the belt was advertised as genuin leather. Only the inside of that belt was real leather.<br /><br />So...<br /><br />I was very happy to discover that all of this belt is real leather. My only complaint<br />is that the money pocked is a little smaller then on my old belt. BUT... I was able to<br />put 10 bills inside of it pretty easily. So... I guess you could store up to $1000 in it<br />if you wanted too.<br /><br />The zipper is nice because it hides pretty flat. They were smart to cut out a little bit<br />of the leather on this inside for the zipper.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars if the buckle attachement to the main part of the belt felt a<br />little more solid and if the money pouch were a little bigger.<br /><br />As it is, I might upgrade my review to 5 stars after a month or so of wearing this belt.<br /><br />I was very nervous of which belt to buy and looking at the reviews helped me a lot.<br />The material of this belt is real leather and is very solid and looks good.<br /><br />>>>><br />OK. I have been using this thing for some weeks now and I wear it EVERY DAY.<br />I am not particularly fat or anything so it is not holding a LOT of pressure BUT...<br /><br />It is working perfectly. The area around the hole and the buckle are staying solid,<br />which was my main fear from my last belt of this type. So... I am moving my<br />review from 4 to 5 Stars.<br /><br />The belt buckle has held up totally fine and I am enjoying the adjust ability of it<br />I list about 1 button hole of weight and if it stays off I will be shrinking the belt<br /> a bit. When I travel I always lose weight so I will wait to seeif it stays off but<br />then i will."

In person the product looks so much better than the photo. The gold really shines and is a nice color, the back of the controller is black, but it looks very clean and sleek. Only downside is the fingerprints which are easy to remove with a cloth, I even bought a case to protect my controller as I'm so in love with it.<br /><br />The mods work PERFECT. They are activated using the d-pad, which at first I thought might mess me up in game but surprisingly its easy to use, and quick to activate. I have yet to accidentally enable a mod in game. Rapid fire works great as do all the other add ons, I was surprised at how great the mod worked considering the console has not been out very long but no complaints here! Works great on COD Ghosts and Titanfall. Going to be picking up a few of the other chrome colors that Geniusmods offers."

As such, he needed a water proof watch that was also, as he puts it, cool. So, this digital watch was ideal and it is water resistant to 99 feet, which is more than sufficient for any depth that my son will be swimming to.<br /><br />However, a friend of my husbands is an amateur diver and he has a watch like this one to go scuba diving, so it musts stand up to that level of the sport. It has only basic features such as an alarm and timer but what more does a thirteen year old by need with his watch? It does have a small nightlight so he can read the time when it is dark, hand to remind him what time he needs to be back home for. A great watch for a great price."

10042,5,N,Video Games,B00RZ7TC6Y,HORI Duraflexi Clear Protector for Nintendo NEW 3DS XL,but it was well worth my time because they are great and fit like a custom made glove,"It took me 10mins overall to apply these screen protectors, but it was well worth my time because they are great and fit like a custom made glove. These 10 long minutes are due to the fact that I abhor dust and air bubbles (so much so that if there is one spec I can see and can't fix I will remove the whole thing and use another one), therefore, I meticulously cleaned both screens, which took the majority of the time. The instructions do seem complicated but if you take the time to look at the pictographs you'll be fine.<br /><br />Basically adhere the protector to your device, grab the protruding end on the right, slowly pull away towards the right, remove air bubbles with the cheap cardboard &#34;tool&#34; they give you (or a credit card), peel off the secondary layer and remove any excess bubbles.<br /><br />If you take the time to make sure everything's dust free you won't regret this purchase. And since you only get one shot I wouldn't rush it, not for $9 bucks a pop."
10043,5,N,Home Entertainment,B00QTDTUVM,Sony XBR55X800B 55-Inch 4K Ultra HD Smart LED TV (2014 Model),Fantastic TV,"Congratulations, you just saved $100 from the cheaper version http://fave.co/1c3qCuA  I purchased this TV from an authorized dealer in Seattle because I didn't want to wait. Price was the same, and I would still have to pay tax in Seattle on Amazon. I have owned the 55&#34; version of the TV for a month and a half.  On research I was put off by the XBR900B having better dimming and contrast control but having the speakers on the side that I find to be quite gawdy. I wish there was an intermediate between the it and the XBR850B that had the dimming but not the speakers, but I digress. I checked this out in the store vs the Samsung 8550 and 7150. Both the 8550 and XBR850B blow away the 7150 with the same content moved to each one. I personally prefer the Sony to the Samsung. The Samsung is over saturated and isn't as crisp. The Sony XBR850B just looks better to me. I also tried out the Sony XBR800B and the difference in color is very noticeable.  I started using the stand, but eventually ordered one of these to mount it. It looks GREAT mounted! http://fave.co/1c3qDPf  The menu is easy to navigate. The settings are easy. The out of the box calibration is nearly perfect. The smart app functions work well. The 4K upscaling is incredible. It makes 1080P look like broadcast junk.  The build quality on this is excellent. The camera folds back so it is invisible from the front. I'm sure you have been reading the same things that I did on the interwebs. &#34;Panel Lottery,&#34; &#34;Clouding,&#34; &#34;Flashlighting,&#34; ""Soap Opera Effect"", etc. There is a tiny spot on the righthand side that I can see being a tad bit brighter. When I first noticed it, I really noticed it. The next day I could hardly see it, and it doesn't distract me at all. A couple adjustments to backlighting and brightness and I can't see it anymore except on boot-up. I don't notice any clouding except maybe on the boot screen, maybe. I do not see it on the netflix screen or anything like that. You can change settings and see Soap Opera Effect, but you can also change those settings back and not see it. Really, that is more of a problem with processor sharping because all LCD/LED tvs are blurry in movement. TVs of this caliber are fast enough to sharpen and make the motion seem natural.  Where the tire meets the road, as the old saying goes, is where this TV shines. Everything is beautiful on it. Streamed Netflix is beautiful, iTunes purchases streamed by the Apple TV are beautiful, Blu-Rays in my PS4 are beautiful, and games on my PS4 are beautiful.  I shopped around. I educated myself. I kicked the tires on many TVs. I was very informed. You really have to spend a lot more coin to get better performance than what this TV delivers and the percentage better is extremely minimal for the large jump in price. At the sale price of $1750 before tax, this is really the best performance for coin spent. Black are deep, colors are vibrant, resolution is incredible, upscaling works flawlessly and makes quite a huge difference, and it is mesmerizing. I am confident that I will enjoy this TV for a long time. I highly recommend this TV. I apologize if this review doesn't have discussions on black room viewing (I turn the brightness down 4 at night and it looks great), TV lingo, what serial number panel is installed (I have better things to do with my life), or every spec of the TV (that is available online easily.) I really enjoy my purchase and think you will too, especially at this price at this time. Also, don't worry about the 4K content, the upscaling is incredible. It will take the industry years to adapt to this since it just adapted to 1080P. This TV looks better than 1080P tv while viewing 1080P content.  In summary, I now recommend all my friends check out the: http://fave.co/1bKKvpy  I really hope you found this review helpful. Jessicaag=i60-25"

10092,5,N,Video Games,B003VUO6H4,Sony Playstation 3 160GB System,ps3 is the best,"play station is like the best invention ever, after Nintendo 64 of course. the gaming graphics are the best and i really couldn't be happier than having this type of gaming consoles, i bought mine on black Friday which really doesn't make a difference in the price but well it makes myself looked i spend less.<br /><br />the graphics are so much better with the HDMI cable, and if you have the HDMI you don't need to plug in the AV cables, and the best of using the HDMI is that if you turn on the console from the controller the TV will change itself to HDMI and the same when turning it off, it will turn itself to the channel it was (whatever you were using).<br /><br />i like ps3 better than XBOX because online is free and because the controllers feel more comfortable the controllers also are much better because they don't weight as much as the xbox controllers. the ps3 slim is a lot thinner than the ps3 before, that is the only difference, i really can't wait for the ps4 to be released, i heard is in october or somewhere around there so i can't wait for it. highly recommended. but i must warn you that you should wait for the ps4 which will be a lot more better than this one."

The pieces weren't labeled so I had no idea what was what but I did eventually figure it out.

10240,5,N,Home Entertainment,B00NVRRFN4,VIZIO E400I-B2 40-Inch 1080p Smart LED TV (Refurbished),Great TV,"Yes this is refurbished. Yes it works just like the standard brand. But with this one you save $100 over the non-refurbished price tag http://fave.co/1bLffXC  The VIZIO E400I-B2 40-Inch 1080p Smart LED kicks the pants of many LCDs that cost a lot more. Employing minimal zones and actual LEDs (to bring down costs) and much-improved dimming logic, the E series achieves truly remarkable black-level performance. The rest of its picture is also plenty good, and its price is simply phenomenal.  And comparing it to other TV's on the market, Vizio's E series doesn't hold a candle to the picture quality of a great plasma like this one http://fave.co/1c3T3sw  But again, look at that price tag...  Here are the 2 adjustments I'd recommend: --Go to Picture&#62;Advanced Picture then set the BLACK DETAIL to HIGH to get those rich blacks. The default is OFF which I don't understand -- why have a great feature like this then bury it in the settings and turn it off? --Right below Black Detail is BACKLIGHT CONTROL. The default is ON -- turn it OFF. I think it's a mode that saves a tiny bit of power but looks awful with the backlight always fluctuating. It might save 3¬¢ per month so yeah turn it off.  I like to keep things simple so I found these picture settings to be just dandy: Backlight - 35 Brightness - 35 Contrast - 95 Color - 50 Tint - 0 Sharpness - 50 (Advanced Picture) Color Temperature - Normal Black Detail - High Backlight Control - Off Reduce Signal Noise - Low Reduce Black Noise - Low Film Mode - Auto  OR these settings: Backlight - 50 Brightness - 50 Contrast - 50 Color - 50 Tint - 0 Sharpness - 50 (Advanced Picture) Color Temperature - Normal Black Detail - High Backlight Control - Off Reduce Signal Noise - Low Reduce Black Noise - Low Film Mode - Autoce Black Noise - Low<br />Film Mode - Auto"

10344,5,N,Home Entertainment,B00SMCHWJU,VIZIO D24h-C1 24-Inch 720p LED TV,I recommend it!,"I've had the    http://fave.co/1bQuUp5   for almost a month now and have used it everyday extensively. I give it a solid 5 stars because it admirably performs way above it's price range. A 28 inch LED HDTV at the $200 price level is an amazing accomplishment all on its own. -- The TV has its quirks, some which would cause it to lose a star or two if it was twice the price or more as other brands are for the same thing. And so complaints about the TV in other reviews here are comparable to reviewing a $10K new car and complaining that the power window motor isn't as smooth or powerful as in their $70K Mercedes, and that the engine isn't as smooth and powerful as a car several times its price - or the stereo isn't as fancy, etc. --- This TV is a $200 28 inch LED HDTV - so keep that in context and you'll be amazed by it. The only other TV I would possibly consider at this price point would be the    http://fave.co/1bQvjb5  The picture is absolutely perfect - high-def sharp - the colors are all perfect with no video distortions anywhere across the entire screen. The complaints about this TVs audio is really strange, because the audio is quite good - much better than I would expect for such a low priced TV. -- I suppose if you put this TV in a large living room - viewing it from 14 to 16 feet away, then the audio may not be perfect for that application.  The overall aesthetics of the TV are also quite impressive - very sleek with a thin black border frame, sitting on a wide stable stand that is one of the best designs for a TV stand I've ever seen - placing the TV low to surface it is sitting on - making it very secure on its feet - instead of the way its done on almost all other TVs; stupidly stuck up in the air on some spindly center pole.  The inputs on this TV are indeed limited. It doesn't have three or four of every input imaginable. Instead, it has two HDMI inputs, one component input, one VGA (RGB-PC) input for your computer, and a 75 ohm cable input. As far as which HDMI cables to use I recommend amazon's very own    http://fave.co/1bQuuPE  That's it, but if you need more than that, then you should be prepared and willing to spend a lot more than $200. --- I use my E280-B1 for both a TV and a computer monitor and I am very impressed with its performance as a computer monitor. A 28 inch dedicated computer monitor costs twice as much as this TV, yet this TV outperforms all the dedicated hi-def digital computer monitors I've had - very impressive indeed.  There are some quirks. The earphone audio output comes from the factory at a unusably low audio level, which is unaffected by the volume control. To make the earphone jack useful, you need to go into the Menu - choose &#34;Audio&#34; and then &#34;Analog Audio Out&#34; and change that setting from &#34;Fixed&#34; to &#34;Variable&#34; -- back out of the menu and your earphone jack in now useful and controlled by the TVs volume control. - And the remote control is much smaller than other remotes, so it takes some getting used to before it feels comfortable to use. The RC being small takes away space that could have been used to include the four main input selections as dedicated buttons - instead of having to go into &#34;Input&#34; each time and scroll to choose the one you want. Other than these quirks, the TV is most definitely as good as it gets - and much more - for a $200 TV.  It deserves 4.9 stars, but since there is no such rating, rounding to the nearest whole number gives it 5 stars. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone needing a hi-def TV for a small room or their office to be used as a TV and monitor - because you get way more than what you paid for.....  In the end I recommend the    http://fave.co/1bQuUp5"

10363,5,N,Watches,B001A62M04,Casio Men's GW9200-1 G-Shock Riseman Alti-Therm Solar Atomic Watch,Best-looking G-Shock,"Pros:<br />-The best looking G-Shock and digital watch I could find, period. Worth spending $130 (what I paid in 10.2011) just for the look. Looks bad-ass, manly, and heavy duty. You are no doubt to attract glances from everyone around you. I got compliments from women and friends who usually criticize my style.<br />-There is no unnecessary flash, so can wear at the gym or more formal occasions.<br />-This is a man's watch and makes every other G-Shock look either hideous or as a cheap toy. If Batman wore a watch, this would be it.<br />-The home screen is well utilized - every pixel has a purpose.<br />-Very light and fits comfortably. Not too big - just perfect. However, it's not comfortable to sleep with it on, so I take it off at night.<br />-Solar charging is a big plus. Battery lasts 9 months on full charge without any exposure to sunlight. No need to change or worry about the battery. Ever. It conserves light by shutting off the display at night, which turns back on the moment you pick it up in the morning.<br />-Stopwatch, timer, and five alarms with one snooze are very useful. I especially use the snooze option to remind me to take my medication at the same time each day. I do, however, wish there was a vibrate option (like the newer GD350, which was released Feb 2013).<br />-Can see (a pre-set) second timezone at the press of a button.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-No seconds adjustment in timer, only minutes. I need to set intervals for doing sets while working out, and I wish to be able to adjust the timer to the second (like 1min 30sec).<br />-Stopwatch is very elementary, whereas it has a lot more potential given the three-line display. Unlike the G7700 (which utilizes its 3-line displays perfectly), it only shows elapsed/split times (which even cheap digital watches do).<br />-Alarm is too quiet, I wish there was a volume adjust setting. I often miss it at the gym when timing my sets, and I don't even bother relying on it to wake me up.<br />-The light stays on too briefly, for about 1.5 sec. I wish I could adjust the duration of the backlight to set it to 2-3 seconds (the newer GD350 has 1, 3, and 5 second light options).<br />-Atomic timekeeping hard to get in SF area (Notice, the G9200 does not have atomic timekeeping).<br />-I never use the barometer (although the barometer display is cool to look at), thermometer, or altimeter (which is inaccurate, because its reading is based on the barometer). Thermometer is not reliable - off by up to 10 degrees Fa (have to take it off for at least 5 minutes to get accurate reading). Also, too much scrolling through the barometer, altimeter, and the altimeter-record functions (like 7 or 8 for full cycle).<br />-No compass... in case of a zombie apocalypse, you know.<br /><br />Overall, the best-looking digital watch you can find. However, I can do without the barometer and altimeter (and maybe even the atomic timing). I'd like it to have the option for a vibrator alarm and to be able to adjust the timer to the second."

Had it for about 2 weeks and I must admit that it has proved itself to be a great purchase. The sound is really loud with a little bassy which I like. No need for a sound bar. The picture is really huge and the HD is spot on. The colors are bright and the only problem I have is when I watch stream crackle movies through my Xbox."

10466,5,N,Home Entertainment,B00S5MBB1C,Upstar P32ES8 32-Inch 720p LED TV (2015 Model),Great TV after a lot of tweaking,"If you're anything like me you see that this TV is labeled as LED; then you look at the picture and see a lot of fat for the usual Samsung LED depth. Make no mistake this is an LED TV. I got this for my bedroom to replace my 23 inch Samsung Syncmaster. It is great for the price and I'd recommend it. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00C18YRSA  I use this TV mostly for 1080 mp4 movies and blurays (I download what I want to watch instead of waiting for it on cable), and my Xbox and PS3.  Long story short, Comcast had me thinking I purchased my first dud from Samsung. Seriously, the colors look washed out and none of the channels really had that crisp clear picture I was hoping for. If you plan to use this solely for Comcast, I can't really recommend it. In fact, I've always found blu ray quality to be so much better than cable that I've stopped using cable for anything but football and cartoons. Movies MUST be in my PS3's blu ray player or my own 1080p files.  I learned 2 things about the TV right off the bat. If you have Comcast, you cannot fully customize the TV's picture. An essential feature called HDMI black levels actually looks much better when its set to low. I have 2 different Comcast HD boxes and since neither of them broadcast at 1080, this feature is locked out.  I had a good experience mounting it with this http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B000WYVBR0  The second thing I learned about is what the depth is for. Samsung didn't advertise this (or maybe its just my TV), but I have absolutely NO BACKLIGHT BLEED. When Black Ops goes to the loading screen on my Xbox, it gets so dark that I think the TV is off! The only indication that it is on is the Black Ops logo in the corner spinning. There isn't even the SLIGHTEST inkling of white anywhere! I'm not exaggerating. The obvious second reason why this TV is fat for an LED is that Samsung made an effort to improve the sound. When I turn on the HD surround coupled with the movie option, there is much more bass than I thought it would be. THe explosions in my games and the soundtracks in movies sound vastly better than I thought they would. Granted, I am not the type to go out and spend 600 on some Bose speakers, but the sound is NOT a con for me this time around.  NOW ON TO THE PICTURE  As I said, I was not exactly thrilled with the picture RIGHT off the bat. It looked like my old 23 inch Syncmaster, just a lot bigger. Let me tell you, this is not one of those TV's that look great right out of the box. You have to toy around with the settings a bit to get the optimal picture. I wanted sharpness coupled with colors that pop like crazy.....and I got it. Dynamic is the brightest setting, but I coupled this with the HDMI black levels set to low (option not available for Comcast cable box) and voila, moving photographs! I'm not a pro but this is my setup:  Mode: Dynamic Backlight: 18 Contrast: 85 Brightness: 50 Sharpness: 80 Color: 70 TInt: G/R 50/50 Standard color tone with screen fit in the additional options, with HDMI black level set to low.  My games and blurays look AMAZING. The picture is easily better than my mom's 46 inch Samsung up front. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B0071NWYP8  REMEMBER that some of the good options are cut off from Comcast and the use of component cables. In games, I do have to up the brightness or gamma a little, but it ends up looking BRILLIANT. I am going through my entire library of games and they feel like entirely new experiences! There is a 32 inch 720p option as well, but I just was not comfortable with 720p max. The new game consoles are gojng to have native 1080 so that's what I wanted. BTW did I mention I'm a big gamer?  THE CONS  WITH A COMCAST CABLE BOX I could see no difference between HDMI and component. I kept switching back and fourth, but since the max output is 1080i, there were no differences in picture.  Well I saw this TV up on Amazon before it was on Samsung's website. Yeah, WOW. Sometimes I wanted to see the TVs specs from Samsung directly before I made my buy. Make no mistake this is NOT a 120 HZ tv although it is labeled as one. I have no idea what clearmotion 120 is, but it makes my TV much darker. The feature is entirely useless and does nothing to the picture or add the &#34;soap opera&#34; effect like I had hoped (it looks great for games).  VERDICT  With a lot of tweaking, I got the picture to look beautiful. I will use my Comcast box sparingly, but I might move to FIOS if the support full 1080. Watching movies on my PS3 and playing games on my Xbox stopped me from returning the TV. I will not be surprised if this set gets bad reviews from Comcast users (even though Its not Samsung's fault). I'm a &#34;videophile&#34; and this passed my personal test with vibrant colors.  In the end get yourself one of these http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00S5MBB1C"

10531,4,N,Watches,B0066T2IAY,Fossil Men's JR1357 Nate Chronograph Black Leather Watch,Beautiful large watch with easy to read clean face,"As a watch lover, this watch is a beautiful piece to wear and enjoy.  This is a large watch, the face is 50mm across, and about 53mm when you include the protruding hands and timer buttons.  I've had my watch a few months now and it's accurate and keeps good time.  The day counter does need to be adjusted forward when there's less than 31 days in a month.  The watch bezel rotates counter clockwise and clicks to lock in place.  Oddly enough it has 7 clicks for each 5 minutes, which really isn't an issue because it does line up on each 5 minute indicator.<br /><br />The band is very thick and robust leather.  The band is about 3mm thick and thus about as thick as the buttons that stick out on the right side.  One great feature of the band is that it includes the really simple to use Fossil release slider on each half.  On the under-side where it connects to the watch case there is a small spring loaded tab you simply side one way to release the bands.  This makes them easy to trade out for many of the other available options.  For example Fossil sells a silicone rubber band that I also enjoy and it's a simple process to make the change.  This opens up the option of having different colors for different looks and or outfits or occasions.<br /><br />The watch has a timer which will keep track by the second up to 30 minutes.  There's a second hand timer (bottom center dial) in addition to the sweep second hand.  There's a 30 minute small counter (upper left small dial).  The upper right small dial is a 24 hour time that shows you which hour of 24 the watch is showing.  I like the sweep second hand and appreciate that since many watches no longer have that.  The top button is the ""start/stop"" timer function.  The lower button is the ""reset"" button once you've stopped the timer.<br /><br />One of the additional features this watch includes is that any of the Fossil stores will replace the battery for $10 and guarantee it for a year.  That's a pretty nice benefit when manywatch shops can charge $30 or more for a new battery.<br /><br />This is a large watch, you need to keep it up on your wrist a little to keep the button protrusions from bumping into your wrist as you bend your wrist.  If you had a job where there was a risk of a possible snag or catch risk I would suggest a smaller watch.  Of course the trend now is for these larger watches.  This one is very easy to read with a clean simple font for the face.  The internal characters are very clean cut from what appears to be raised plastic and have a nice 3D look.<br /><br />4 stars for a beautifully crafted watch that I enjoy wearing."

The case can hold 3 game cartridges and 1 memory card.  I WISH that it could hold 6 and no memory card.  I have a 32 GB card and I don't intend on switching these out.<br />2.  I wish it had a detachable strap...even a hand strap would be great.

It has a lot of attachment pieces but the main vacuum was not hard at all, then the pieces just snapped in.<br /><br />It IS heavy and I'm glad that I have a single story house.  I don't think I'd want to carry it up and down stairs.  However, once you turn it on, it practically pushes itself so it is very good at self propulsion.  The suction is incredible.  It is loud, but it does suck up the junk.<br /><br />Features I like:  I love that it has a knob to turn to change from bottom suction to the attachments.  It's a nice feature that makes work a bit easier.  It has a pet paw for doing upholstery with a nice long reach, and the cord is long too.  The canister is easy to empty and put back for me, but is not designed nearly as well as the Hoover Bagless T-Series canister. I love that they've painted the ON/OFF lever RED and have it so that you can kick it with a foot.  I review a lot of vacuum cleaners and it is so nice just to be able to FIND the on/off switch so quickly, and sometimes when you are working, you suddenly see a Lego or something in the floor and the lever switch will let you turn it off quickly before you damage a belt.  The cord is very long and I suppose it is too much to wish it would retract.  It's nice be able to cover my central hall AND my living room.  It  has HEPA filtration, which is great for allergy sufferers.<br /><br /> Out of the box this does seem to have a bit more suction than most vacuums in this price range. I've used it about a month and haven't noticed a decrease, if it doesn't last over time, I'll update this review.<br /><br />MY DISLIKES:  It's bulky and big to store, and it is heavy.  While this is not a problem PUSHING it, it might be if you need to carry it around. Replacement filters for the HEPA filtration system might be expensive.  I wish the cord was retractable.  I don't see a way to turn the brushes off for hardwood floors."

I wanted to try something more on the natural/organic side as well. Having used Burt's Bees products before I took a chance. I am so glad I did. It is thick, creamy, and light once you rub it in. I have been using it for almost a month and NO break outs. In fact I think my skin even looks better, it feels moisturized. You also do not need to use a lot.

This one won't break the bank, but it has a look of a far pricier watch than it actually is for those occasions.<br /><br />Better yet, it comes with 2 band colors both in leather: tan and black so you can easily match one's belt and shoes with accessorizing the watch for the evening or day as well.<br /><br />I personally prefer a watch with an all gold band if worn daily so that you don't have to wear out the band taking it on and off for showering or swimming, but for that occasional dressy outing, this works perfectly.<br /><br />The face being a skeleton of the watch creates a more stylish and interesting look for the piece of jewelry and quite frankly if you are a woman who loves a large watch, it can flow both ways just because of the beauty of the piece. The fancy box it comes in equals the look of the watch.<br /><br />That said, I have to agree with the other reviewer who mentioned it being difficult to read at times. I find the same problem and concur. The hands being small and the cut out making dark areas of the watch, they often blend in together and can cause reading the hand incorrectly.<br /><br />But for the value, it's not a constant problem and not one that would make one set aside the watch in favor of another in our opinion."

This timepiece from Citizen, actually does more to confuse the owner than drive in regards to the overall value of the piece. It does have a lovely leather strap and significant movement, but that is really all there is to it. What I do not like about the watch is that you see the watch in 3 directions.

They don't make replacement parts, so you'll have to buy another one soon.","Revised review (see original below)  I recommend you not buy this product because of the Omron planned obsolescence policy.  Within a year or so of purchase, the bladder and tubing failed.    I phoned Omron customer service to purchase replacement bladder and was told to buy a new unit.  This is not the first time one of these units lasted only a year or two for me even though used as directed.  Original review was as follows:  The cuff is really wide.  I'm 6'1&#34;, and it covers my upper arm.  Compared to my 15 year old lumiscope 13&#34; cuff, the readings are a little higher (not lower), but the arm to arm reproducibility is better.  I can't explain it, but although I think it's a little less sensitive, the ear sounds are louder.  Maybe less high frequency and louder bass.  I recommend this brand because the construction is sturdy (less good than the old lumiscope, but I can't find that).  Compared to other cuffs available from Amazon:  The $25 and under nylon bladder cuffs I have tried don't work at all.  My last cuff from amazon was made of cheap chinese rubber and decayed in two years (check that there is a long warrantee; this one had limited 1 year parts).  The Majestic has a latex bladder and I was hopeful enough after having spent a lot of time shopping for something like my lumiscope that I purchased a second as back-up.  The weak point of the unit may be the cords, and I suppose they are replaceable.  I haven't yet checked for replacement parts"

I find this interesting because that‚Äôs not really what Nyman‚Äôs music is about. First off, he is most well-known for the film score for ‚ÄúThe Piano‚Äù and wrote film scores for some Peter Greenaway films. (So, is John Williams a ‚Äúclassical composer‚Äù?<br /><br />Next is the fact that most recordings of his music are by the Michael Nyman BAND (not Michael Nyman Orchestra!). And look at the instruments he uses: French horn, electric guitar, drum, and only two or three string players.  And most of his ‚Äúpieces are short, lasting from two to 5 minutes.  Yes he does write repetitive rhythms like Phillip Glass but Nyman‚Äôs work is fast and he ‚Äúborrows‚Äù tunes to insert in his pieces. While I like Phillip Glass and John Adams, I LOVE Nyman‚Äôs work.<br /><br />This wonderful Bluray disc contains the 2009 concert held in the German label Arthaus‚Äôs intimate concert hall. The occasion was the premiere of Nyman‚Äôs tribute to the work of Handel: I piece titled ‚ÄúMusicologist Scorse‚Äù. At 21:31 it is the only one of the 16 pieces in this 89 minute concert. The others are some of Nyman‚Äôs ‚Äúhits‚Äù (but not ‚ÄúThe Piano‚Äù and a few that are new (or were in 2010). The camera work is superb!  As a bonus ‚Äì for those not familiar with the composer ‚Äì is a 52-minute film ‚ÄúMichael Nyman ‚Äì Composer in Progress‚Äù from 2009. This film has been available on another DVD from Arthaus, but it‚Äôs nice to have it here as a bonus.<br /><br />If you are a Nyman fan like me, you‚Äôll want to see this BD. If you are new to Nyman and have a short attention span to instrumental works, this is a great start since you can watch the ‚Äúportrait‚Äù first and then the concert.<br />The BD comes with a 20-page booklet of photos and an essay in English, French and German.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />‚ÄúAnything Phonographic‚Äù"

It's padded reasonably well for being transported in luggage, a laptop bag, etc., but I'm not sure I'd want it to be a standalone case.<br /><br />I hadn't seen this in person before ordering, so I was a little surprised by how soft the case is -- not only in feel, but construction. It just isn't going to stand up to too much.<br /><br />The interior divider does a great job of holding games, but isn't stitched all the way through, so there's some risk of hard objects one one side scratching the other side, if the divider shifts too much. Similarly, I definitely wouldn't want to use this for carrying around much more than a USB cable, cleaning cloth, and some games. Fitting the AC adapter and power cord in the pouch is possible, I guess, but I'd be really concerned about the plug scratching my Vita.<br /><br />Amazon usually has this for almost half off MSRP, which is a very nice deal.

So I posted my issue on the Scream Factory facebook page, and they were kind enough to respond to the post:<br /><br />Sorry but there is not a 5.1 track on the theatrical cut on all discs. We discovered the misprint that it include it after the wrap had printed.<br /><br />The misprint shouldn't even be considered the problem. They couldn't include the 5.1 audio mix that already exists since it was on the DVD??? So much for Blu-ray giving you the ultimate movie experience.

10679,4,N,Books,1878424076,Seth Speaks: The Eternal Validity of the Soul,Can anyone please check the dog pound?,"Together with ""The Seth Material"", ""Seth speaks"" is the most well-known book featuring Seth starring himself. Apparently, this book pretty much started the New Age channelling craze. Seth is a multi-dimensional, spiritual personality from another plane of existence, who periodically speaks through the mouth of medium Jane Roberts (whom he calls Ruburt).<br /><br />Now, that sentence should really be in the past tense, since Roberts is deceased, but Seth claims that time doesn't really exist, so I might as well speak in the present tense, wouldn't you agree?<br /><br />I tend to avoid channelled material, but the few items I somehow managed to sift through were quite different from ""Seth speaks"". This book blends incredibly dense, pseudo-philosophical and boring prose with a strange and much welcome sense of humour. In general, the channelled spirits seem to take themselves far too seriously! Seth makes slips of the tongue (at one point forgetting the number of chapters he has dictated), has a love-hate relationship with cats, claims to have lost his dog somewhere on our planet, and seems fond of beer! He also insists on starting every other sentence with the words ""Now"". At one point he jokingly refers to himself as a ghostwriter...<br /><br />As for Seth's message, it's another version of New Age thinking - I sometimes wonder how many versions there might be out there?<br /><br />God isn't a person, but an ever-evolving Consciousness, referred to by Seth as All That Is. Time as we know it doesn't exist. An almost infinite number of alternate realities co-exist simultaneously. (In some parallel universe, Seth's dog presumably wasn't taken by the dog-catcher.) Strictly speaking, reincarnation therefore doesn't exist either, since all our ""previous lives"" exist at the same time. We are all multi-dimensional personalities, living on many different planes of existence, constantly evolving in innumerable directions. We are also somehow part of God, who is the ultimate multi-dimensional entity. Weirdly for a system that lacks time, All That Is nevertheless evolves and constantly creates new forms. This is, of course, impossible for us puny mortals to comprehend. Everything that happens to us is created by ourselves. Our consciousness creates our reality, whether good, bad or ugly. Our material world with all its suffering is a mass hallucination. We should all learn and evolve.<br /><br />Since everything is an illusion suspended in a timeless Now (pun intended), it's difficult to see the point of the exercise. How can you learn and evolve within an illusion where everything exists simultaneously? At various points in ""Seth speaks"", our friend tends to mellow his message somewhat. I have already pointed out that All That Is apparently evolves despite there not being any time, and it would seem that our existence in some sense isn't completely illusory, after all. As for suffering and evil, Seth concedes that suffering doesn't necessarily have to exist, that we suffer due to our unevolved state, and that the point of suffering is to teach us to overcome suffering - a somewhat softer view than that taken by, say, Dolores Cannon (see my previous review on this plane of existence). Still, when it comes to the philosophical points about time, space, matter and consciousness, I would say that a few books by David Ray Griffin might do Seth some good...<br /><br />Seth also says a few scandalous things about Jesus. Is anyone surprised? Apparently, Jesus was part of a broader personality incarnating as three distinct human beings: John the Baptist, Jesus and Paul. In 2075, Paul will return. This is tantamount to the Second Coming. Seth is unsure about the crucifixion. At one point, he seems to be suggesting that the entire Gospel stories are dramas and dreams, ""real"" on a psychic level but not in any material-historical sense. At another point, he spins a scenario similar to the Muslim one, only more weird. (Of course, the Muslim traditionsabout Jesus are in themselves warped versions of the Gnostic ""laughing saviour"".) Apparently, Jesus got away. Judas deliberately ""betrayed"" the wrong man to the authorities, a poor deluded crackpot who thought he was the Christ and absolutely wanted to be crucified. In drugged condition, this substitute was indeed executed by the Romans. His body was stolen by some of the disciples in the dead of night (hence the empty tomb). The real Jesus then appeared to the disciples, who therefore believed he had been resurrected. In reality, he was still alive and well in his physical body. Ah, what evangelical heresy-hunters could do with this!<br /><br />Does Seth really exist? At one point, our ghostwriter comes close to conceding that he doesn't: ""This voice is only used as a symbol of the energy and the strength that is available to each of you, as you utilize those abilities that are your heritage"". A similarity to other channelled material is the amount of historical references which makes no sense. Seth believes in Atlantis. He expounds at length on an underground civilization called Lumania, whose inhabitants were so fearful and shy that they made up the fierce warrior god Jehovah as a protector. Seth claims to have been a certain 4th century pope, but no such pope is recorded by history. More damningly, Seth claims that a Muslim Arab he once met wavered between faith in Allah and faith in Moses - an absurd proposition. Presumably, Seth or Ruburt have mixed up Allah with Muhammad! But even that is absurd, since Muslims recognize Moses as a prophet. Somebody should send Seth a book by Huston Smith on comparative religion, c/o Lumania.<br /><br />Part of my own multi-dimensional personage wants to believe that Seth is a real being and even help him find that poor dog of his (probably a Newfie). The other part feels that Seth is simply a part of Jane Roberts' earthly personality. He doesn't say anything that's *really* out of the ordinary compared to what every other Theosophist, kabbalist or esotericist has already said - except those parts that can be checked and disproved. But then, I suppose followers of Seth could claim that their beloved entity really did get some things completely wrong. In contrast to many other purported spirit guides, Seth is strangely unassuming.<br /><br />Despite the humour, I can't say ""Seth speaks"" is an easy read. It's repetitive, long-winding and often really boring. But yes, it could be of some interest to scholars of comparative religion or new agey seekers. One sure wonders how the contemporary spiritual scene would have looked like, had more entities like Seth been channelled by the Neo-Theosophical faithful? Imagine a conversation between Seth and Osho!<br /><br />Now, I'm not sure how to rate ""Seth speaks"", but finally I decided to play it nice and give our dog-loving, beer-sipping and vaguely Islamophobic ghostwriter three and a half stars."

10699,3,N,Camera,B00AR95FPO,Sony HDR-PJ380/B High Definition Handycam Camcorder with 3.0-Inch LCD (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Teeny Tiny Mess,"The Sony HDR-PJ380 is a miniscule, light weight video camera with a built in projector that frustrates me. On the bright side, the video quality is good, the zoom range is impressive (from really wide angle to stalker telephoto) and the recorded sound is excellent. On the dim side, the camera is an ergonomic mess, the projector is weak, the lens quality is sad.<br /><br />December 6, 2014 Update: In the two years I have owned this camera, it has proven to be exactly what I thought from the beginning. I used the projector maybe 4 times and that was just to make people laugh. It is frankly a worthless attachment on the camera. The clip to hold the battery in has broken. That attachment point is a really cheap piece of plastic. The only reason I continued to use the camera is the wide angle lens. I used to shoot volleyball matches in tight areas. The wide angle was a major benefit. This camera is a teeny tiny mess.<br /><br />This is one of those video cameras that seem like a great idea; include a pico projector so people can watch videos right away, no television needed. In practice, it doesn't work out quite that well. The projector is really dim, the room has to be pretty darn dark to see the video and it has to be projected onto a white wall. The sound from the camera is just barely useful (I still can't find the volume control). This camera is capable of really good HD video, projected the video looks sad.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with this camera is the ergonomics, how does this thing feel in my hand and how easy is it to use. I could never find a way to grip the camera with my right hand so that I could work the record button and the zoom button. My hand was always twisted around in an uncomfortable position and I couldn't hold the camera steady. Using my left hand on the screen wasn't a whole lot of help either. I do have big hands. The strap cannot be removed. I could get it to just barely fit my hand.<br /><br />There is this ridiculous USB cable built into the camera with no way to remove that useless piece of computer connection. The thing is poked into a slot in the camera grip. Personally, this is just extra weight to carry around. The pigtail is short, plugging into a laptop might work, but forget a desktop computer. The box does include a USB extension cord (but hey, I have to carry that around to use the camera, why not just make the cable detachable like every other camera manufacturer).<br /><br />The camera has a power switch located behind the flip out touchscreen, which has to be the single dumbest place to put a power button. When the video screen is flipped open, the camera turns on. In order to use the power button, the video screen has to be flipped open - turning on the camera. The other two buttons behind the video screen are a play button which switches the camera into playback mode and back to shooting mode; and a projector button that turns the projector off and on. Once the projector is on, the touchscreen no longer works. Menus and video selection has to be done with the Zoom lever and the photo button. This was a combination that I couldn't master, it was almost impossible to use. The even worst part of this whole mess - whatever memory was selected in the Setup menu, is the memory used for playback and projection. What a pain in the rear to switch between the internal memory and an SD card.<br /><br />Along with the three oddly placed buttons, there is a miniHDMI input and output port. The box contains a miniHDMI to standard HDMI cable. There is also a 3.5mm jack for a microphone or &#34;plug in power&#34; (whatever that means).<br /><br />There is a tiny flip door on the side of the camera for some kind of multifunction connector (no cable was included for that) and the AC adapter to charge the camera. The bottom of the camera has a trap door at the rear for an SD card and the tripod socket is in the center of the camera. If a tripod quick change plate is mounted on this camera, it is highly likely that the SD slot will be covered. Oddly, the battery release can be moved from either underneath the camera or from the side behind the video screen door. This is another mixed blessing - if I have the camera mounted on a tripod, I can open up the video door, turning on the camera, and then slide the battery release to remove the battery, turning off the camera.<br /><br />The disaster is that all the buttons on the camera are virtual; meaning everything to control this camera is on the touchscreen. That would be OK if there was some logic to the menus and buttons on the screen. This is the biggest mess of menus I have ever seen. The menus are: Shooting Mode, Camera/Mic, Image Quality/Size, Playback Function, Edit/Copy, and Setup. The Setup submenu is about 50 selections all in some odd groupings that are accessed by scrolling down (not swiping like in an iPhone, but touching an arrow to make the menu roll down one page). Finding the settings I need is the most frustrating complicated thing I have ever seen.<br /><br />The lens on this camera is not good. Outside chromatic aberration was bad (this is blue fringing around white objects against a dark background). The 55X end of the video is so soft, it is just barely useable. I have a sense that there is some kind of digital enhancement for the far end of the telephoto because the image goes very soft. Oddly, there is a setting to go even further with digital zoom (I had this setting turned off, and the video was still horribly soft). The worst part of this lens is the coating, there just doesn't appear to be any multilayer anti-reflection coating on the lens. I have never seen so much front element flare in my life. I was shooting in a room with fairly bright lights overhead; depending on where I stood the image was completely washed out with flare. From the exact same spot, my iPhone didn't have that problem.<br /><br />The only good thing about this lens is the wide angle. It is one of the widest lenses I have ever seen. I shoot volleyball matches and this is perfect to get the full court into the shot.<br /><br />Still images are just fine outside. Indoors in low light, image noise is a huge problem - the pictures are extremely grainy. I would say they are just slightly worse than an iPhone in the same situation.<br /><br />The video quality is good. I have a Canon HD video camera (Vixia HFM400) and the video looks pretty similar between these two. Image stabilization is surprisingly good on this camera. It does filter out hand shakiness surprisingly well.<br /><br />The recorded audio is absolutely outstanding. This blew me away, with all the other problems with this camera; I didn't expect the sound to be that good. I recorded a friend's rock concert - I'm pretty certain the audio was up in the 100db range, it was loud. The camera managed to attenuate that sound and record it perfectly. That's a feat not many cameras can accomplish. As usual, the microphone picks up sound all around, so noise will be picked up from everywhere.<br /><br />There are some decent features that took me a while to figure out and find. I do like the focus follow feature; touching the screen on the thing you want to maintain in focus will then follow that thing around the screen keeping it in nearly perfect focus. The battery seems to have a fairly long life. The camera does weigh nothing at all - it is teeny tiny (shoot the AC adapter is almost bigger and heavier than the camera).<br /><br />The camera is very particular about SD cards. I tried an ez Share 16GB class 10 card, the camera got all finicky about recording to it. The first three minute clip recorded fine, but then the camera went into an impossible to leave circle of trying to recover images and files from the card. I eventually went back to the internal memory. The first clip was recorded correctly.<br /><br />Transferring movies to a computer is a living nightmare. For some unknown reason the computer can only see thememory that was selected for recording. So if I need to transfer movies from both the internal memory and an SD card, I have to connect the camera twice messing with that stupid setup menu to select recording media. It is a stupid waste of time. The video and still images are included in a single folder. This connects at USB 2 speeds - meaning it takes forever to transfer HD movies.<br /><br />I didn't mess with any Sony software for this camera. There was no disc included in the box, only a website to go download software. In fact there was no description of what software I could get there or why I might need it.<br /><br />There is a lot that I dislike about this camera. For the price, there are much better cameras with better ergonomics, better lenses, and easier to use. On the other hand, I haven't seen a camera with as wide a lens, and none of the others have a projector. If for some reason you absolutely have to have a projector on your camera, well this is the camera for you. When it comes down to it, this is more like a $250 camcorder that had a projector bolted on for an additional $150."

My bad. I took the radio out walking with me and it works fine, and it picks up a lot of AM and FM stations. I guess the reception inside my house is bad for some reason, but out in the open this radio performs very well. Sound is a bit tinny, but that's to be expected for such a small radio and at such a low price. I'm glad I bought it. It does what I wanted it to do: allow me to pick up NPR and the local classical music station when I'm doing my daily walk.  As a bonus, I can also pick up the CBS AM station (740, KCBS) in San Francisco, which is a great source of Bay Area traffic and weather information, updated every 10 minutes."

The cover also doubles as a tarp for hiding boxes and items left in the back seat or hatch when we leave them in the car for storage or moving.

10719,5,N,Grocery,B00MLPXPD6,"Bakol Jel Dessert, Strawberry, 3 Ounce (Pack of 12)","cleaner alternative to Jello.  Not as firm or brightly colored, but SO much better for you!","We stopped eating Jello years ago, because of the toxic dyes, fake flavoring and other crap ingredients.  I (ok, my daughter) spotted this Bakol Jel Strawberry dessert in the grocery store last week (about $3.50 a package) and was very happy to see this cleaner, non gmo version.  It's made with 100% natural ingredients, non gmo, gluten free, and certified vegan.  It is not as vibrant as usual Jello, but so what.  It's so much better for you, so try to deal with it.  We tried making the Jel in our old Jello molds, and it actually came out ok, not as firm as jello but it still held its shape.  However, it is more watery, so when making it, I decrease the water it calls for a bit.  Also, if you let the set Jel warm to room temperature, it becomes very runny.  The taste is good though, very strawberry, but not in the intense, fake and artificial way.  If you are expecting something exactly like Jello, you will be disappointed.  If you have been searching for a cleaner alternative to jello, give this Bakol Jel a chance. We are happy to have found it, because the kids can finally have (occasionally) their gelatin dessert. The ingredients are: evaporated cane juice, vegetable gum, citric acid, potassium citrate, natural flavor, beet powder. I apologize for taking a picture of it on an orange plate, it's hard to see the color (which is a pale pink).  The Jel had been completely devoured by the kids before I could correct my mistake!"

10733,4,Y,Sports,B004WN7OGE,ProActive ProMark Stencil,It works well enough,"I used to buy and play with only brand-new balls.  Then I remembered how terrible I was at golf, and kept losing them.  So, now I only use second hand Callaways.  Which has been great - I like the brand and not everyone uses them.  Or so I thought.  People I have been playing with ALSO use Callaway balls, and since mine are all different, I never know what # was on my ball, or what exact kind of Callaway it was.  I'd been looking for a nice way to mark my balls, without being too obnoxious.  I didn't want to scrawl my initials on there, or draw a line, or a picture of a whale or what-not.  That's how I decided on this gadget.  I can use it to cleanly and neatly mark my initials on a ball.<br />The contraptions works like this:  It's a blue shell that fits over the golf ball. There's a clear section which fits inside between the ball and the cover.  There's another part of the blue cover that you screw on to the underside of the ball.  The ball fits snugly inside, and you can rotate the clear inner ring to get to the letter or number you need.  It rotates fairly cleanly: it sort of ""clicks"" with each rotation, so that it holds relatively steady when you are trying to fill in your letter or number.<br />-<br />It's not the best device:<br />- It's hard to screw the bottom thing on.  You really have to press and turn to get it to fit correctly, and many times, mine wasn't all the way on, or the ball would move as I was trying to do this and so it would mess up where I wanted to put my initials.<br />- The inner ring is steady, but not great.  It can move around a little while trying to shade in a character.  It's really not all that bad, but you do have to be careful.  I hold the device so that my hand presses down on the inner ring as well to hold it steady.<br />--<br />It does work OK:<br />- The included pen works well, and it dries quickly and doesn't smudge.<br />- It's stable enough so that I can get my intials on there fairly decently.<br />----<br />The blue shell also has a line on it if you need to draw a line on your ball - some people do that for alignment I guess.<br />I do recommend this device.  I am happy with the results, and it's certainly priced right!!!"
10737,5,Y,Pet Products,B007HT7HH6,"1000ct Live Crickets, Large Size Crickets",Great for supplemental feeding of Purple Martins...,"These crickets are great for supplemental feeding of Purple Martins during times when they are unable to feed on flying insects due to inclement weather (temperatures below 40 degrees, excessive rain, wind or fog, periods of excessive heat and drought). Crickets are similar to grasshoppers which are a natural part of a Martin's diet.<br /><br />When the crickets arrive, place the box in the freezer overnight. Once frozen, open the box and separate numbers of them into multiple zip lock bags. This way you can take them out of the freezer one bag full at a time and allow them to thaw and reach room temperature for feeding to your Martins. When you open the shoebox size box you will find the crickets within several layers of cardboard egg crate material. The best and least messy way to remove the crickets is to lay several sheets of newspaper on a non-carpeted floor (if available) and shake the contents of the egg crate material and the box onto it. Then when you are done sorting and bagging the crickets you can simply fold up and discard of the newspaper and with it the cricket ""debris"" (food remains and feces).<br /><br />Martins must be trained to accept the crickets as food, so you need to wait until such time as they are unable to feed on flying insects and are hungry before attempting supplemental feeding for the first time. Then you can use a plastic spoon to flip crickets into the air for your Martins to ""catch"" by putting a cricket in the bowl of the spoon and holding the handle of the spoon with your dominant hand while using the index finger of your other hand to pull back on the top/tip of the bowl of the spoon slightly bending the spoon and flicking/flipping the cricket straight up and airborne near enough and within the Martins eyesight. If the Martins are perched on their housing, flip the crickets up near them so that they can see them. If they begin to fly keep flipping crickets when they are near and especially when they are flying lower to the ground. The first time I tried this the Martins had been suffering through a week of constantly cold, rainy weather in which no insects were moving. At first only two of my Martins flew to ""catch"" the crickets I sent airborne, but on the 3rd day of attempted supplemental feeding, the rest of the Martins were just so hungry that as they watched the two Martins that were flying and ""catching"" the crickets they eventually gave in to their hunger and joined in, too.<br /><br />If you plan on trying to feed Martins that are already too weak to fly you can try placing some crickets in their gourds or housing.<br /><br />Crickets, mealworms and pieces of cooked beef heart can be offered on raised feeding platforms, too. These platforms can be purchased from the Purple Martin Conservation Association (purplemartin.org) which is a non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of Purple Martins.<br /><br />If your Martins are already used to accepting crushed egg shells or [[ASIN:B00AOJOBSE crushed oyster shells]] from a platform, they will more quickly accept supplemental feeding from platforms. Martins readily eat egg shells and crushed oyster shells and also feed them to their young as a source of grit and calcium. Extra calcium is extremely important for female Martins to produce strong eggs, and also for growing babies. A Martin's normal diet has plenty of protein, but they must get calcium in other ways. They will collect pieces of clam shell, fish bones, mussels, and snail shells from nearby lakes, rivers, ponds and creeks on their own, but can conserve precious energy spent in search of them when provided crushed eggs shells or crushed oyster shells. Just remember that chicken egg shells must be rinsed in cold water and then baked in a 200 degree oven for 10 minutes to kill bacteria such as salmonella before crushing them.<br /><br />NOTE: Many Martin landlords feed their birds scrambled eggs and while this may be okay in a pinch to feed to adult birds in inclementweather when their normal diet of flying insects is not available, scrambled eggs have high fat content and should not be fed regularly. Scrambled eggs are also not recommended for nestlings. Long term use of scrambled eggs will cause loose stool/diarrhea due to the high fat content. Cooked beef heart can be offered as a substitute to or alongside of mealworms and crickets, but ONLY BEEF and not pork.<br /><br />Also, mealworms and crickets can be sprinkled with calcium (in the form of crushed and powdered Calcium 600mg w/D tablets) before feeding to Martins in order to give them the calcium they need in their diet."

My Dad, though, plays almost daily, so I brought these 3 balls with me on my last visit, and we both gave them a try.<br /><br />For me, I couldn't see any difference between these Callaways and the Callaways my father regularly uses (hex black).  I'm not very good no matter what ball I'm playing with!  But my father felt that the hex chromes were tooo soft; they are supposed to have a 'soft feel' but these, he says, are more mushy.<br /><br />Bottom Line: A mediocre golfer's game is not improved with the hex chrome, a strong golfer may find them too soft.  My father did point out that a golfer with more experience than I have (who is therefore more discerning), but who has a weaker swing than he does (maybe a woman golfer) might enjoy these balls."

This is a good designed tool that is manufactured in China. I really like the spring on the pliers. You will hate the pouch. Always hangs up. If you can only have one tool would I recommend this over a Leatherman? No it's not the Leatherman made in USA quality. Leatherman and Gerber both have outstanding warranties, you will be more likely to need the Gerbers in my experience.<br />This tool feels good in your hand, and it's the best Gerber multi tool ever. My older Gerber multi tool got so loose and then when I pulled it from the pouch after not using for awhile had serious rust and I just shook my head and trashed it. Their newer tools are much better thankfully, but that looseness possibility still concerns me. The one thing to check in comparing tools side by side is the machining of the Phillips head screwdrivers. In that attention to detail regard Leatherman and Sog still better the Gerber."
10817,5,N,Baby,B00HAZSBIG,Munchkin Bath Fun Bubble Blower Toy,Redesign seems to have done the trick...,"My toy arrived and I admit I had some frustration getting it out of the packaging, this little bird was tied in TIGHT.  I'm glad I didn't alert my little one that it had arrived because he would have had to wait a LONG time for me to first get the thing out of the packaging and then try to get the battery cover off to get the batteries in.    Once I had achieved that herculean task though, operation couldn't have been more smooth.  There's a little button for off and on at the top of birdies' head and that's all it takes for him to start up the fun after you add the bubble solution.  You can use any type of bubble solution you like undiluted.    I found that this does actually seem to be best for the tub or barring that, outdoors because of the wetness factor.  I personally would NEVER use this indoors except in the tub.  It does tend to get wet underneath and around the unit, so if that is going to be an issue just place it on top of a towel or something like that.  Really - I think that is why this is labeled as a ""tub toy"" primarily.    It works well and delights children.  I had no issues with the operation of it.  Especially boisterous youngsters may accidentally knock this over if using this outside without aid of the suction cup.... so supervision might be in order.    EDIT 2-17-15 Still working well on original set of batteries.   I do note that if you don't empty out the bubble stuff each time or run it out that it will leak out.   We have just taken to leaving this permanently in the bathroom tub on the ledge so it's not that big a deal but worth noting if you want to conserve your bubbles or think you might be returning to ""use them later"".   I also note that when we switched bubble brands to a cheaper one we can't use it continually for more than five minutes at a time.... we have to let the bird ""rest"" because the bubbles get too thick and sudzy and it can't spit them out as well.   So if we turn it off for a few minutes then turn it on again that seemsto do the trick.  We could go back to using the more expensive bubbles.... but since our system works and our 4 year old seems ok with our explanation of the bird needing to ""rest"" it doesn't seem to pressing to pay more money."
10822,4,N,Home,B00G00BTEA,McCulloch MC1385 Deluxe Canister Steam System,"Not my silver bullet for cleaning grout, but a really nice cleaner overall","[[VIDEOID:mo1NPCSAEORZPD5]]Over the past month, I've had the chance to audition the McCulloch [[ASIN:B00G00BTY0 MC1230 Handheld Steam Cleaner]], [[ASIN:B00G00BT72 MC1375 Canister Steam System]], and the [[ASIN:B00G00BTEA MC1385 Deluxe Canister Steam System]].  All of them come across to me as being well made, and none of them seem like they are overpriced.  Prior to trying these, I've owned a [[ASIN:B000I618NY Wagner 905]] for over four years.  The video shows the three McCulloch cleaners side by side, shows the included accessories, and discusses the individual cleaners a bit (sorry it's so long, but there's an outline at the front that shows when each segment is).<br /><br />I admit that I had high hopes about this model (and the slightly less expensive 1375) before they arrived because they are higher pressure cleaners than the Wagner.  I bought the Wagner to help clean grout in my new tile, but it never did a very good job with it.  I thought the added pressure might be the added boost that I needed.  To cut to the chase - it wasn't.  I might be using these wrong, but they just don't seem to get the grout any cleaner than a wet cloth does.  So, a disappointment for me on the grout, but I still recommend it if you're looking for a steam cleaner for the following reasons.<br /><br />Pros and why I like it:<br />(*) The steam mop attachment on this (and it's the same on the 1375) is fantastic!  Soooo much better and quieter than the one I've been using on the Wagner.  I think McCulloch did a great job with that.  I'm particularly aware of it because that all I really use the Wagner for anymore, and this model was just an overall better experience. I had stopped using the Wagner and had switched to a regular mop, but I believe that I'll switch back to steaming.  This and the 1385 are just so easy to use, and the tiles seem really clean afterwards<br />(*) The hole to pour water into is in a recessed area, so you don't have to use a funnel or have perfect aim to avoid a mess.  The shape of the opening serves as its own funnel.  I love that!  It's a big improvement over the Wagner model that I own<br />(*) Well made.  All of the accessories feel solid and fit well, and the main unit also seems solid<br />(*) Long power cord<br />(*) Long extension steam hose<br />(*) Really good set of included accessories, including a window squeegee and some extra spares not included with the 1375<br />(*) Fairly high pressure steam with an analog dial showing the pressure<br />(*) Comfortable handle and trigger<br />(*) Ability to adjust the steam flow with a dial right on the handle by the trigger<br />(*) Can wrap up the power cord like on a vacuum cleaner<br />(*) Extendable handle let's you easily roll it around like one of those roller carry-on luggage bags<br /><br />While it didn't help me with the specific problem (dirty grout) that I was hoping it would, it does a really nice job steam mopping my tile, and it's well made with a good set of accessories.  It's an enormous step up from the Wagner that I bought years ago, that's for sure.  This is the most expensive of the three McCullochs that I tried, and about twice as expensive as the Wagner that I've had for years, but I think it's the best value out of the lot.  The added convenience features, higher pressure steam, and good set of accessories put it at the top.  Recommended."

I saw discussions online about how packing cubes really help consolidate your items to make room for more stuff.  So I thought I'd try the Travelwise Cube System.  I just got back from a six-day trip, and I have to say that I am very favorably impressed with the quality and performance of these cubes.  I got waaay more into a carry-on size suitcase than I would have previously believed possible.  I just rolled my clothes, and put them into a cube, stacked in a row just like pencils in a box.  And surprisingly, this method did not result in the clothes coming out badly wrinkled.<br /><br />These cubes are extremely well-made.  The seams and the zippers appear to be quite strong, and the materials are high quality.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!<br /><br />(Bonus:  TSA can see exactly what's inside the cube, so your clothes don't get rummaged through during security checks.)"

He runs into some issues as Jan really doesn't want to be rescued at this time and there are all kinds of people looking for her and will kill anyone who gets in the way. Avery gets in deep, and stays committed as the story takes a twist.<br /><br />This is a crime/drama with some action. The characters didn't grab you. There was nothing special about the twist, in fact it made the film cliche and formulaic. Glen Gould plays a rather boring leading man. It makes for an acceptable Canadian rental at best.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex or nudity."
10839,4,N,Books,0803738552,Counting by 7s,A beautiful story - a no spoilers review,"This is one of the most beautiful stories I've read in a long time. It's about a 12 year old girl named Willow who looks and acts different from typical girls her age. She's a genius but the quirks don't stop there. She gets joy out of counting by sevens and is obsessed with medical symptoms and diagnoses of diseases. After disaster strikes, Willow has to find a way to cope with the motley group of people she unexpectedly finds herself among.<br /><br />This book has all the making of a Newbery gold medalist: strong character development, a lovable and unique protagonist, a death (but it happens early so it's not a depressing book), well written prose and unexpected hilarious moments interspersed. I really enjoyed it and hope it gets at least some recognition by way of awards.<br /><br />That said, even though I think it's an excellent book, I am dubious that the target age group would enjoy it. The beginning is slow and, due to the early death, was hard to get into. There were days I didn't want to pick it up because I didn't want to read about grieving. Once I got past that, I was eager to open its pages. But I can't help but think that adolescents would not be as tenacious with their reading. Also, there aren't any heart-racing moments where the excitement peaks. This is a book to savor and to relish, not to grip with white knuckled fingers at 2am.<br /><br />But personally for me, an adult, I was enchanted by it and am glad to have read it.<br /><br />P.S I know I mentioned the death but since the product description mentions it, I didn't consider it a spoiler."

10850,1,N,Books,0761452915,Exiled: Memoirs of a Camel,"a bit mature for children, and heavy on Islam indoctrination","I was torn on how to review this book. On one hand, the book is a page turner, but as a children's book (or at least children's reading level), it's hard not to be a page-turner... on the other hand, the references to the Q'uran and Allah were nearly on every single page. It was over the top. I do not have a problem with children being exposed to other cultures or other religions - but this was not exposure - this was non-stop praise for Allah. Each chapter opens with a quote from the Q'uran and nearly every page has either a person or a camel praising Allah. I don't know if it was put in there to try to add realism to the story, but it was so emphasized, it made itself way too obvious. It was a distraction to the story. I was interested in reading this book when I read the description because of the history of the US Camel Corps. I had never heard of this experiment in American history and was intrigued by the story. The camels were captured and sold in Egypt to the US government - so I get the names they used - many of which were the authentic names of actual camels and people involved in the Camel Corps. The camels bowing to pray to Allah was a bit much. Even without the non-stop indoctrination (seriously - nearly every page), the content was a bit intense for young readers. The book is listed as for grades 4-8. Even without addressing the all-Allah-all-the-time references, the subject matter seems to be beyond what I'd feel comfortable with even a 7th grader reading. Camels mating, camels killing each other, and the Egyptian cameleer anxious to go into town to get to the prostitutes. Seriously? I'm not sure what the editors were thinking and why they didn't rein some of this in. The story of the US Camel Corps is one that needs to be told - I just think there's a better way to tell this story to young children. When looking at the book as a whole - it's goal to tell the story to children, it fails as it is too mature and heavy on religious indoctrination - whether or not that was the intent of the author."

10889,4,N,Video DVD,B007X0TTXE,Don 2 [Blu-ray] (Shah Rukh Khan / Hindi Movie / Bollywood Film / Indian Cinema),"It is not just difficult to predict all the plot twists in Don 2, it's impossible!","That review title above is a straight up fib. It's not at all difficult to predict all the plot twists in DON 2. But so what? For fans of Shahrukh Khan and for those who relish slick action thrillers, DON 2 checks all the boxes. It's been five years since the events in DON, five years since that shocking final reveal. But some things don't change. These days, our guy is still running game on the underworld, still outfoxing the badge and his competitors. The woman he betrayed, Roma Bhagat (Priyanka Chopra), is now an Interpol officer. She's obsessed with nabbing him.<br /><br />The film opens with Don holding it down as the undisputed kingpin of the Asian underworld, except that he's now got his eye on a take over of the European drug cartel. On the French Riviera, the European bosses attend an emergency meeting to discuss Don's recent actions. Don is jeopardizing their drug empire by undercutting the asking price of their product. What they decide on is inevitable.<br /><br />Back in Malaysia, Don gets wind of the contract on his head in the rudest of manners. There and then, he determines to be a free man once and for all. He sets into motion one of those whirlwind capers, key elements of which hinge on the springing of his old enemy from prison (Boman Irani) and a daring heist in Berlin. But Don finds himself navigating a nest of vipers, his accomplices composed of deceitful villains. With law enforcement nipping at his heels, has Don at last bitten off more than he can chew? Or does that iconic phrase still hold true? ""Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahi, namumkim hai."" Translation: ""It is not just difficult to catch Don, it's impossible!""<br /><br />If you're anticipating a retread of the 2006 film, you need to turn in your anticipating badge. For one thing, there aren't so many swerves in this one. Don does assume a disguise, but it's not as relevant to the plot as much as it is a chance to showcase Hrithik Roshan in a cool cameo (Hrithik even dances with Priyanka).And if that really is Hrithik saying Don's dialogue, then big ups to him for nicely matching Shahrukh's voice and cadence. Don is so gifted, as part of his disguise, he grew a few inches.<br /><br />I thought Priyanka Chopra did well in a role that required her character, Roma, to be conflicted. Don is so magnetic that Roma still can't help but feel that attraction, never mind that Don had betrayed her, never mind that he'd murdered her brother. Thankfully, the film keeps this sub-plot mostly on simmer, never allows it to take over the narrative. Lara Dutta has a lesser role, filling in for Ishaa Koppikar as Don's most trusted companion. Both women look absolutely devastating!<br /><br />The manly man's credo: Give me my popcorn and a comfy sofa and babes to ogle and lots of fight scenes and explosions... and I'm good. Because sometimes and maybe most times, I dispense with the artsy-fartsy stuff and I demand to be entertained by a loud action blockbuster. DON 2 lacks the smarts and fascinating twists of the 2006 film. And I don't know that it was a sound move to inject a sliver of conscience into Don. What made him unique was that he was an unrepentant anti-hero, a straight up, no good villain. Or maybe it doesn't matter. Shahrukh Khan's larger-than-life charisma and his showmanship are stamped onto the screen and your eyes are glued to the guy. Shahrukh also performs his own stunts, again perpetuating the notion that absolutely no one can fill his shoes. I guess, one other contention is that I prefer Don to apply his wits to achieve his ends. Here, he frequently resorts to action hero methods. Ultimately, the 2006 film had built up so much cachet I can't dog on its sequel too much. DON 2 is the Hindi version of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. It's over-the-top and preposterous and great bloody fun. As a fan of Bollywood cinema, I think it's always a treat whenever Boman Irani plays the bad guy. Whether in drama or thriller or comedy, Boman Irani is effortless. There aren't alot of musical numbers here (I think, three). But the tracks all carry strains of ""Main Hoon Don,"" a club banger from the 2006 film and one of the most addictive, catchy Bollywood songs ever. Okay, another beef? How much more clever would it have been if, instead of Hrithik Roshan, it was Abhishek Bachan whose face Don assumes? Abhishek looks enough like his dad, Amitabh, who played the original Don in 1978, that the reference would've been awesome.<br /><br />What I have is the 2-disc DVD set. Disc 1 has the feature presentation, available with English sub-titles and the option to jump to any of the film's three musical segments (this last feature is also available on Disc 2). Disc 2 has the following bonus features:<br /><br />- Making Of featurette (mostly in English, running time 40 minutes)<br />- Songs: ""Zaraa Dil Ko Thaam Lo,"" Hai Ye Maya,"" ""Dushman Mera""<br />- (Promotional?) Music Video from DON 2 featuring Shahrukh Khan: ""Mujhko Pehchaanlo"""

I remember getting toy plastic dinosaurs when I was a child and they were all grey or brown with hard smooth skins.  Now some have the colors of birds (or lizards), feathers and other structures that are considered more useful for mating displays than any other purpose. Beginning with a brief exposition of the evolution of animals with backbones, the book goes from the Triassic to the Cenozoic (the rise of the first large mammals)<br /><br />Not just fascinating facts about dinosaurs, but also information about creatures that don't get a lot of attention, like Titanoboa, a gigantic South American snake that was as long as a school bus. There's also the two and half meter tall flightless bird and the Andrewsarchus.<br /><br />I've had this on book on my desk for a week now and it never fails to catch the attention of the numerous adults who wonder through.  They inevitably pick it up and I've had to rescue it a couple of times from being carried off by rapt readers.<br /><br />This one is mine, but I know a couple of dinosaur obsessed children who are going to get copies as holiday gifts.  I thoroughly recommend this book."

10918,3,N,Video DVD,B009AJB0YM,10 Years,Watchable but also forgettable,"Just what we needed is another high school reunion romantic comedy featuring mostly impossibly good looking former classmates, all with some hang-ups or dragged baggage.  The cast is fine and each pairing has a story.<br /><br />Channing Tatum is Jake and his real life wife, Jenna Dewan-Tatum is his girlfriend Jess.  He's been working up to popping the big marriage question but puts it off until after the reunion.  Once there he finds his old high school sweetheart, Mary (Rosario Dawson) along with her new husband (Ron Livingston) in tow.  Then we have drunken party boy Cully (Chris Pratt) and his disapproving wife (Ari Graynor).  Also Lynn Collins as the former high school party girl, still trying to live up to that image, but with a secret.  Best friends played by Justin Long and Max Minghella are living on a fantasy reputation and seek to get in Anna's (Collins) pants.  One of the more interesting pairings is Oscar Isaac as Reeves who has become a famous pop star whose long ago crush on Elise (Kate Mara) has been reignited.<br /><br />If this all sounds all too formulaic, well it is.  On the other hand the performances are solid enough and there are enough chuckles and bubbling emotions to keep the audience interested for 90 minutes.  Watchable but also forgettable."
10919,4,N,Wireless,B00604RZ12,Belkin Anti-Smudge Screen Protector for Apple iPod Touch 4th Generation (2 Pack),Easy to Install and Does the Job,"Overall, this cover does what it is supposed to do: it protects your iPod's screen and reduces the glare - in my case it helps stop a lot of the smudgy fingerprints.  This one was not too hard to line up and put on, either.<br /><br />Before you install it on your iPod, let me point out a couple of things:<br /><br />1. Clean your iPod's screen with the soft cloth that comes with the screen protector. DO NOT use water to assist you, but use a gentle wiping motion with the cloth. Why? You don't want to put the cover over a bunch of fingerprints and have your fingerprints memorialized on your iPod!<br /><br />2. Make sure you use the straight-edge that comes with it, or a credit card, to help smooth out the bubbles.<br /><br />3. Be patient, line it up, and go slow! This cover doesn't have much wiggle-room to be slightly off - if you go just a fraction at an angle to one side, you will start covering the iPod's edge case vs. the screen. If that happens, slowly back it up and start again.<br /><br />Overall, this is not too bad and does what it is supposed to do, and I think you would rather have a screen protector vs. a scratched up iPod!"

We put this mailbox up a week ago - took my boyfriend 30 minutes I think, using the adapter - available on amazon for $13; super easy - snaps onto the bottom of this mailbox & allows you to easily attach this to a wooden 4x4 post.  This replaced our incredibly old quintessential metal mailbox.<br /><br />I'm a serious online shopper (although oddly enough I bought this at walmart for $30) - but I tend to get anywhere from 5-20 packages a week.  Most come from UPS, but a few come via USPS.  The other day I was expecting 2 from USPS so when I saw him drive on without bringing anything up to the door I was kinda annoyed.

10970,3,N,Musical Instruments,B001U0ORJE,DW Drums Retro-Style Bass Drum Single Tom Mount,"Not solid at all, but fits vintage rail mount hole patterns","My mount came on my DW special edition Buddy Rich tribute kit in the Classic series. It has some nice features like a quick tightening lever in the L-rod, and it came with some semi-nice features like the memory lock on the rail. The latter may be useful to some folks, but it also takes up some real estate on the rail itself, diminishing how far you can shift the tom position.<br /><br />While the construction is typical DW perfection, the design is not. It incorporates the worst aspects of a rail mount. Specifically, it slips. A simple light knurling on the rail or the inside of the clamp that grabs it would have prevented that. I have to brace the rack tom that is on my kit against my snare drum to hold it in position. To me that is a major failing.<br /><br />On the plus side, the hole pattern will fit the Walberg & Auge rail that was used by Ludwig, Slingerland, Leedy and others when this was the way to mount a tom. I measured it on my 1961 Slingerland lit as well as a Gretsch round badge kit. Of course it will not fit the Ludwig models that had the four-hole pattern that they used in the 1960s.<br /><br />Also, if you are making a purchase decision as to whether this or the [[ASIN:B0016HCG94 Gibraltar SC-GVRM Vint Rail Mount 10.5Mm L-Rod]] will best suit your needs I would personally opt for this one. I have owned and used both and this one is better constructed and sits a little lower for approximately the same price (at the time of this review).  However, be aware that both are flawed and both have slipping problems.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rail for a vintage kit you may want to check out the Steve Maxwell rail that is easy enough to find with a web search. That one is built to the old Walberg & Auge specs,  but with better tolerances and is actually less apt to slip than this DW rail or the Gibraltar model.<br /><br />I love my DW kit, but this rail is the weak link."

This consists of a sheet of plastic with punched out letters.  I agree with other posters that the seller should be more specific about how large the individual letters are rather than the size of the overall sheet.  One work-around is to download the jpg, size it to 7x10&#34;, and print it out.  This will give you a very good idea of the sizes.<br /><br />The main problem I have with stencils is not securing them tight enough to the item I am stenciling.  In this case, I found it much easier to cut the individual words out and tape them down tightly.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fine product and I will get a lot of use out of it.

Lots of new bad guys were introduced, and dispatched.  But lots of plot threads were introduced and developed.  Eventually, one especially noticeable bad guy appeared, and didn't get dispatched, so it became clear how the season would wind up; the only remaining question was how it would unfold.<br /><br />The bad guy was a prominent one-season bad guy from another TV show.  He does creepy really well.  In the interest of avoiding any kind of spoiler, I won't say who it is, but those of you who saw that other show a couple years ago will recognize him immediately.<br /><br />I don't know if it was the complexity of all the plot threads, or whether they were presented less clearly as in previous seasons, but it wasn't always obvious why things were happening.  There are many things to note and remember to really get what's going on, but the problem is there are many other things that aren't essential to the main thread going on, too.<br /><br />There are hints about how it will all end sprinkled liberally through the plot.  Even so, it is satisfying to watch it all unfold.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Four Stars (""I Like It"").  I thought the first two seasons were excellent, and this was a small notch down.  I'll watch the fourth season."

This board has many things going for it, several of which I will list:<br /><br />1) It is well made, and despite being MSI's budget motherboard, it compares nicely to boards in the $100+ category.<br />2) It has four memory slots for a maximum of 32GB of RAM, not bad for a low-end board at all!<br />3) It has USB 3.0 ports, something missing from many of its competitors, and even has headers for two more!<br />4) It has a SATA3 port for getting the most of an OS SSD.<br />5) It has one each of PCIEx16, PCIEx1 and PCI, meaning you won't have to upgrade an old PCI card if you don't want to.<br />6) It is compatible with OSX with little to no modification.<br /><br />I was first drawn to MSI's motherboards after reading an article about hackintosh-compatible mATX motherboards. MSI boards, it seems, are just as easy to use as Gigabyte, and in my opinion are MUCH better looking. MSI has done a great job with the color scheme, which is understated without being too muted. With several power saving options, this is a great HTPC/general home use motherboard but don't let that put you off! It supports RAM up to 2400mhz and will play nicely with even the Core i7 processors!<br /><br />Now, I really want to take a second and mention MSI's UEFI BIOS. This thing is amazing, and if you haven'te experienced UEFI BIOS's yet, you're in for a treat. The thing looks great, has intuitive controls, and heck, you can even use your mouse! The BIOS has three settings: power saving, normal and overclocked. It has automatic overclocking (apparently going off of your components automagically) or you can overclock manually. I'm not an overclocker so I can't really comment, but I saw controls for changing clock speeds and voltages for both the CPU and the RAM, as well as various other settings which I'm sure others will find much more useful than I did!<br /><br />I tried to think of some drawbacks to this motherboard, but with USB 3.0 support and four slots of DDR3, the only minor complaint I have is that there is only one SATA3 port. Still, you can have your OS drive on the one avaialble, and the only reason I would want a second is for my test rig. Barr any possible issues like I had with my Z77MA (power cycle loop) I highly recommend this as a VERY attractive 1155 mATX board. I don't think you'll regret choosing this budget board!"

11035,4,N,Health & Personal Care,B00STSUPCS,"Viva Labs TRIPLE STRENGTH Glucosamine, Chondroitin and MSM, GUARANTEED Joint Agony Relief, 240 Capsules",Glucosamine - Chondroitin - MSM,"I've been using glucosamine and chondroitin since around 1990 and then added MSM back around 15 years ago. I had the beginnings of arthritis and other bone problems and way back then, this product was pretty new to the public and I did a lot of research on it, so I'll tell you what my experience has been from using it all of these years.    In general terms, what you're getting here is glucosamine to stimulate cartilage growth, and chondroitin to use for the growth itself. MSM is a chemical found in plants, animals, and humans and is an anti-inflammatory, or a weak version of NSAIDS like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen.    I had help from a physician who specialized in sports medicine back when I started using this. He promoted the use of a concentrated liquid version because it was a more effective delivery system to the body. But his theory made sense to me and it has proved out through the years of me taking this. I'll relate the gist of it.    Every human body is different, but somewhere in your 20's the body starts growing cartilage less effectively and we can begin losing it faster than we regrow it. That's the reason to use this product.    Having back the cartilage that you had when you were younger, is almost universally beneficial. But it doesn't fix injuries and so many other problems. Between my two knees, I've had surgery five times and the doc said that I had good cartilage, which allowed him to cut a lot away while he repaired various tears and other things. A lack of cartilage is just one other problem of many.    Back to my sports doc, his theory on how to use this made sense to me, and this is what he said.    Take a double dose of this for 30-40 days and you should get some fast regrowth and then be able to switch to the normal dose. About this same time, you should be feeling the benefits of having the new growth. If you feel no benefits, it's likely that a lack of of cartilage wasn't the problem that you suffered from in the first place, many don't.    If you're happy with the results, you'll want to continue and grow as much back as possible, but at a point, you won't be anymore and using this product doesn't help, except to replace further loss. I've found that a half dose will maintain and regenerate my own losses, but this would be different for each individual. But you might want to experiment with this to reduce the daily cost of taking it. Taking other supplements like I do, would probably affect this also.    As for this particular product? Only someone just starting out with this one, and taking it for 40-60 days could even have a valid comment on it's effectiveness, not me. This is why I'm telling you of my experience, because you'll have to try it for yourself to see. I'm not loyal to any brand and the additives like MSM are fine, but not a big deal for someone who already takes anti-inflammatory medication. I've also had my knees shot full of hyaluronic acid, which you'll find in some of these. It's a natural lubricant made from rooster combs and it's done little for me, and taking it orally is questionable.     This is likely the 20th brand that I have used and it seems just like others that aren't from the big companies.The only reason for my 4 star rating, is because I like taking this supplement and have for many years, but I can't tell you how well this one works compared to another and I'm being honest about this, because I can't. Anybody telling you of the benefits from taking it just one week, well, I'd be skeptical of. That wasn't how it worked for me or others that I've talked with or my doc's understanding of using it.    Most of all, I hope that I've helped you to understand how and why this product can potentially help you. Try it to find out for yourself, and then you should decide whether or not it helps you, and even if it doesn't seem to help much today, whether or not you like the idea of it preventing future pain from the lack of cartilage.    Because if this is affordable for you, that may be it's biggest selling point in my own mind, you've got a lot of joints to take care of and this can only help them.    This product was provided for me to review."

In addition, it has an adjustable stem so that it can be customized for people of different heights.  The plastic cutter strings are extended not by bumping the machine on the ground but by hitting a switch on the side of the machine.  I bumped the machine on the ground several times before convincing myself to use the switch to extend the string.<br /><br />This is a good trimmer that offers excellent performance; however, it may not be the trimmer I use personally because it is heavier than my old trimmer.  I am much smaller than the average American, and adding extra weight to the trimmer means, for me, that the machine is more difficult to control and that I tire much more quickly when using the trimmer.<br /><br />For small folk, this may not be the trimmer you want.  For everyone else, however, you'll be pleased with the machine and with your results.<br /><br />Four Stars!"

I use their lighting, backdrop frames and have a few of their muslin backdrops including a green screen all of which are excellent products.<br /><br />This particular backdrop was unfortunately a huge disappointment. I know enough to at least<br />understand that a really good, thick top quality muslin background, be it painted or not can set you back upwards of 300 clams.<br /><br />So I try to keep my expectations reasonable when ordering a background at this price point. However, I feel at any price this particular background will disappoint.<br /><br />* Uneven color and terrible dye bleeds cause shadows<br /><br />* The single most wrinkled background I've ever seen. Expect to spend a good hour steaming them out.<br /><br />* Poor quality stitching, means easy rips and tears<br /><br />* Extremely thin Muslin means a myriad of problems with lighting<br /><br />In my opinion this is a terrible choice, especially for the novice or intermediate, I consider myself in the latter category.

One year I ended up with some sort of tarp that we ended up using for our barbecue because no one claimed it.  The Classic cover is going nowhere fast and has a lot of great qualities that make it worth while for anyone with a built-in barbecue to invest in.  We don‚Äôt have a built-in, but still can use the cover.<br /><br />What‚Äôs great about it are the two Velcro straps beneath the cover that will secure it to the barbecue.  Along the edges the material is elasticized, another factor that will keep it from flying away.  If it does, the barbecue will have to go with it because it‚Äôs that secure.  The cover itself is a thick, sturdy 100% woven polyester with a rubberized lining.  This is the type of polyester that I see in backpacks an luggage.<br /><br />There are even some gussets with small circles that will help keep the Classic cover in place when there are heavy gusts of wind.  We do have those and that‚Äôs when we sometimes find an odd assortment of things in our yard.  The gussets will divert those gusts, keeping them from pulling the cover up into the air.  The cover will not only protect the barbecue from the elements, but make it easier to clean.<br /><br />The cover is water-resistant and very well-sewn and designed.  Installation, if you want to call it that, only takes a minute and is intuitive.  This is nothing like those cheap, lightweight tarps that blow away, tear, or get holes in them quickly.  It would take a long time to get any wear on this tarp from putting it on and off.  This is definitely a sturdy, well-made tarp that will protect a barbecue."

The strap is lightweight and comfortable to wear, while being very positively buoyant. If you seek such a strap, I would recommend this one.    We recently received a video camera from SJCam that has a waterproof shell, and have been playing with it in our fish tank and out in the snow (which we have had plenty of these last few weeks). With its waterproof case on, the camera weighs a few ounces so I hooked up this strap to it for our testing... and it went right on up to the top of the tank when let go.    Not too much more to say -- affordable, effective, comfortable and nice looking straps.    As far as hooking this up directly to the camera case (either at a strap port or via a hinge)... it is very easy: make sure that you look closely at the plastic connector on the loop, as this connector allows you to disconnect the loop from the strap. Disconnect it, loop the loop through port or hinge on your camera or device, and then connect the straps back to the loop. Very easy. It seems like some may have missed this, and tried instead to push the straps through the loop...    Neither the Amazon sales page or the retail packaging provides information on a warranty, so if an issue occurs I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive these straps gratis from the seller and put them to use in our fish tank to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.    If you are looking for a high quality pair of highly visible floating wrists straps of this construction, size, style and price, for use as I have noted above, them we would recommend giving these wrist straps from FRiEQ a try based and our experience with them.

Unlike many of games geared toward children, Ravensburger's ""Race To The Roof"" does not cause adults to cringe when a child presents it for playing.<br /><br />""Race To The Roof"" can be played with and enjoyed by children who are younger than the suggested age range of 5 years or older.  The objects to be located are ones with which most children will be familiar; if not, the unfamiliar items provide a learning opportunity.  Counting the spaces one must move reinforces the ability to sequence numbers.  Having to move backward gives children the opportunity to ""overcome"" a set-back and to learn that luck sometimes plays a part in who wins and who loses.<br /><br />The quality of Ravensburger's ""Race To The Roof"" is a bit less than I would have expected.  Instead of a game board that is one-piece and hinged in the center, ""Race To The Roof"" has a two piece game-board.  Unlike older board-game playing surfaces, this item is not constructed of a very heavy cardboard. While it might be somewhat difficult for very young children to damage, determined three-year olds would have no trouble bending the pieces.  The wooden game pieces are unevenly painted; our yellow picec shows the wood-grain around its center point.  Illustrations are simplistic; this seems to be a trend with illustrations in books as well as in games.<br /><br />Ravensburger produces games that are both fun to play and provide learning opportunities for children.  I would like to see Ravensburger use better quality components so that their games last through several children and can be kept by parents to be played with future generations."

11135,4,N,Lawn and Garden,B0096Q19YU,"Victor Tri-Kill Mouse Trap, 1-Pack","Easy to use, no worrying about snapped toes","The high mouse activity area in our home is the kitchen and we often place spring loaded traps on the floors along the walls and cabinets. We don't have a constant mice problem but we will get a couple each year. Usually we only know they've been around if we see droppings or if a dead one shows up in a trap. The only problem was that my husband would wake up with a dry throat, stumble into the kitchen for a drink and then get his toes snapped. I'd jolt awake to loud cursing in the middle of the night.<br /><br />But this trap eliminates that problem. It's very unobtrusive. If friends come over and see the spring loaded traps, they'd immediately know we had mice problems but with this, it's not immediately obvious what this little black box is doing on the floor of my kitchen so that's nice.<br /><br />We haven't caught any mice yet, but that may just be that there are no mice around at the moment. Will update whenever we catch one."

Just okay.  I feel comfortable with my younger son using it because there is no knife included in the tool.  But, it is very bulky and doesn't have a case or anything (which would make a bulkier tool easier to manage, I think).  I used the flathead screwdriver to help my son with a wooden frog punch out.  The screwdrivers aren't too sharp, but are of good size.  For the kid who's 8 or 9 who you just aren't quite ready to get a pocket knife for, I can imagine letting them handle this tool.  I'm going to let my 7 yo son use it.  It's going to stay in our utility drawer in the kitchen.  It's perfect for that.  I won't have to go all the way downstairs for several tools and it will be compact enough to not mind storing.  We also have an interchangeable screwdriver that we use all the time, so I'm certain this tool will be just as handy."

I have been going nuts with smudging my lenses and trying to keep them clean. The cloth is fantastic because it's extra large and plush.  Usually, cleaning cloths are much smaller, making it easy to accidentally get a finger onto what I'm trying to clean fingerprints off of.  And the solution itself wipes away fast and easy, with no streaks. And the fingerprint resistant properties really seem to work; minimizing smudges and prints so I have to clean my glasses less.  I do also use it on my tablet and phone, but mostly this is being used on my eyeglasses. Very happy with it thus far. Would buy again."

If you were, these would not be a bad set of glasses for cutting glare with minimal reduction in visible light.<br /><br />For 3D however, the amount of polarization is insufficient for use with a 3D monitor or a Movie.

Better for the $10 I spent than Drug Store sunglasses of the same price, but again that isn't what they are advertised as, and while a pipe wrench work fine for smashing walnuts, if you bought it to work on plumbing it doesn't get 5 stars if it fails to serve its primary function."

However, once programmed it worked well.  I don't use it for watching the baby since mine are old enough to watch themselves.

I gave up microwaved popcorn several years ago and have gone back to stove popped corn because it tastes so much better, plus I can control the oil, butter and salt.  After popping some corn I split it up into a bowl and a bag.  I wanted to see how it would be to sprinkle it on in a bowl, but also to be able to sprinkle it on in a bag and shake it up.  Both ways worked, but shaking it up in a bag definitely gave it a more even coverage over the popcorn.  As for the flavor I didn't love it, but I did like it and I'm actually very interested in trying the White Cheddar flavor as I think I might enjoy it a bit more."

11175,2,N,Camera,B00RBG68Q6,Panasonic DMC-ZS45 LUMIX 20X Zoom Camera with Wink-Activated Selfie Feature (Black),Very disappointing point and shoot camera.  Panasonic definitely missed the mark on this one!,"I was really disappointed in the Panasonic DMC-ZS45K Lumix.  I had really high hopes for it as the functionality that is listed in the description really makes it sound like a great point and shoot camera.  I have experience with lots of different digital cameras, from the more sophisticated D-SLR cameras to the simplest disposables.  So I was really let down with this one.<br /><br />First off, for the casual user who just wants a simple point and shoot camera, I would not recommend this.  Panasonic did a horrible job of making the basic camera functions as complex as possible, requiring several steps to making adjustments that other cameras innately have available with one click or turn of a dial.  However, even if this wasn't an issue, which after a few days of use it became a little easier to remember where certain features were located, the biggest problem that I have with this camera overall is the horrible delay between pressing the shutter release button and time it takes the camera to snap the photograph.  This drove me crazy on my old freebie smart phone, so when this decently priced camera did it I was really shocked.  Basically what happens is you go to take a picture of say your children, so you line them up, tell them to smile, and push the button, you can almost count to two before the camera takes the picture.  At this point everyone has moved and the picture comes out all wrong or blurry.  It's really a shame.  I even switched the setting over to &#34;action&#34; so that it would increase the shutter speed time, and the results were exactly the same.  So if you tried to use the &#34;action&#34; mode to catch a thrilling shot at a sporting event or something, the picture would be about two seconds later than the one you tried to take!  At that timing, what's the point?<br /><br />I tried playing with the &#34;WINK&#34; setting for taking selfies, and that also needs some more engineering from Panasonic.  It works, but barely.  After setting the camera to take a picture using a &#34;wink&#34; (in the same menu as the countdown mode) you have to really be patient with it, and stand there looking like a crazy person winking slowly at your camera in an over emphasized manner in order for the camera to start a 3 second countdown to take the picture.  Even then, I could only get it to take a picture once every ten or so attempts.  Or you could just set the camera to countdown mode, press the shutter button, and the 3 second countdown happens exactly the same way.<br /><br />For more experienced photographers, Panasonic didn't help you out either.  The manual settings for adjusting aperture and shutter speed require four different steps, toggling between menu functions in order to make your adjustments.  It really shouldn't be that difficult to do these kind of changes, and really wastes a lot of good opportunities by forcing you to do them.<br /><br />There are a lot of cheaper cameras that take great pictures with so much less hassle."
11178,5,N,Toys,B00HXARJ6S,Trash Pack S6 Action Figure (12-Pack),Trash pack series 6 are EGGcellent!,"Series six rotten egg trashies are amazing!! They come hidden inside purple plastic eggs that pull apart at the side into two pieces. This series include some very fresh new and innovative designs. They pretty much all have to do with prehistoric themes. There are ancient eggs-hibits which include dino poop, boggy bonfire, and scum scorcher (also a fire character). There are scrambled animals including the very cool battered bat, puking primate, rotten tooth tiger, and soft boiled sloth to name a few. One of my favorite kinds of trashies in this series are the puke eggs. These are a clear chartreuse egg shaped outer shell with a tiny solid trashy trapped inside. These characters include a poached spider, baked bug, and waste wasp and many more. There is hard boiled trash which feature a speckled, granite like finish. There is eggs-cavated trash which look like fossilized critters stuck in a broken open rock. Some of the characters include sewer slither (a snake), soiled shrimp, oozy octopus, and runny roach. There are eggstinct trash which feature dinosaur characters. There are four limited edition trashies: slime skull, manky maggot, litter lizard, and scrambled rat. These new trash pack additions are very clever and detailed and were a serious hit with my son. Any trash pack collector will crack their shell over these!!"

This has been a favorite snack of all the cats I have had around here for just about as long as they have been making them. It's always been just a snack for them, given out as a few here and there.  And I have always liked the large variety of flavors.  Although these tumblers are made of pretty much the same ingredients as the regular Temptations, I don't like them as much, and neither I believe do the cats.  Although the idea behind these are for cats to play with their food, I don't think most get it or care, and they would just rather eat them.  Also, like a lot of other reviewers here have pointed out, these really are small balls, maybe twice the size of a BB...I don't think the cats recognize them really as balls to play with, or just don't bother too...Out of the three cats I tested them on, two ate them without playing, and one eyeballed them for a while but eventually ate them.  Perhaps finding the small balls rather unusual...    In conclusion, even if these were actually fun for your cat, I don't personally like the ball shape.  I think all three of the cats I feed prefer the Temptations in their traditional shapes that are much easier for them to chew.  The balls are made pretty small for the cats to find chewable, but its my opinion that most still don't like it...I rate these Temptations 4 stars for taste, with the one star off for the balls that I don't think are that good an idea... : )"

11217,5,Y,PC,B00PTKV2SU,Evecase 8.9 ~ 9.7 inch Tablet & iPad Multi-functional Neoprene Messenger Case Tote Bag with Handle and Carrying Strap (Purple),Great for safely carrying tablets,"We purchased a pair of these for our daughters so that they can carry around their tablets without dropping them or damaging them.

A stylus fits nicely in the open compartment on the front.  The inside is lined with a nice shag fleece, and the entire thing feels like a well made item.  The strap is made of the same material as a seatbelt and is soft, yet strong.  The only complaint I would have, although it's not enough to take off a star, is that for little people, the shoulder cushion isn't usable.  By the time the strap is adjusted small enough for a child, for example, the should cushion is pushed all the way to one end of the strap because the buckle will not fit through the pad.  All in all, it's minor for us in the long run, but if you are eager to use that pad, and you are small, just know that it likely won't end up at the top of the strap when it's on your shoulder."

I've probably used more than 100 in my desktops and light use servers and that many again in client desktops/servers. My overall experience has been excellent and this drive, so far, is no exception.<br /><br />After a week with the WD2003FZEX my first impressions are below. I'll update the review as I've lived with the drive for a while and share what I learn.<br /><br />I installed the WD2003FZEX 2TB WD Black drive into a Dell T7500 Precision Workstation. It is being used for data and is not the boot drive which is a [[ASIN:B00CKAOWB6 Seagate 600 series SSD]] that is very fast but power hungry for a SSD: good for desktops, not as much for laptops/tablets.<br /><br />I tried both the built-in SATA2 and an add-in card with SATA3. In all cases Installation was painless and uneventful. The different interfaces did not yield dramatically different results.<br /><br />To get an handle on how this drive's performance changes from the last version I ran some tests on this drive and a older [[ASIN:B004CSIFFS Caviar Black 750 GB SATA III 7200 RPM 64MB - WD7502AAEX]] for comparison.<br /><br />In running casual tests (copying large files, directories of small files, etc.) I got some general impressions of the drive:<br /><br />1) In both large files and small file copies to/from the FZEX outperforms the older AAEX but mostly shines with small file/random access. I believe the improvement for small file/random access is close to 10%. Some of this might be the dual processor and improved caching over older versions.<br /><br />2) it's more noisy than previous versions as has been noted in other reviews. It seems that is a fairly consistent pattern for rotating media drives: faster=noisier.<br /><br />3) The drive runs slightly warm - meaning comfortably warm to the touch. Good for longevity and unusual for a performance drive.<br /><br />The WD Black line of drives comes with a 5 year warranty. I have had few failues with WD drives but when they have happened I have never had a problem with warranty. This has not been so true with other manufacturers (You can read about this in my review of the [[ASIN:B00691WMJG Seagate Momentus XT 750GB Hybrid Drive]]). With a business where I run a lot of hard drives this matters. Warranty is nothing until you need it, then it's everything.<br /><br />The FZEX is a consistent step in the long evolution and ongoing improvement of the WD Black line drives. For consistent quality I have to give this drive 5 stars.<br /><br />Hope this paints a helpful picture of what the drive delivers.<br /><br />Update: Dec 27, 2013<br /><br />After living with the 2TB black drive for a while it seems more quiet than at first. This might be the drive, but I think more likely me just getting used to it. So far no issues or glitches. It is operating perfectly and still feels faster than my older WD Black line drives. I'm still quite satisfied.<br /><br />Another option from WD that is a little unusual and works in laptops and may also be good for compact desktops or all-in-one's is the [[ASIN:B00GSJ9X4Q Black2 Dual Drive 2.5&#34; 120 GB SSD + 1 TB HDD]]. This provides an OS sized 120GB SSD and 1TB HDD in one laptop sized package. This is different from hybrid drives. It uses one 2.5&#34; format package to implement the popular desktop combo of a SSD for the OS and a conventional drive for bulk data. It's on the expensive side but is a good solution for a combination of speed and bulk data. I installed this for a client who does video editing on a laptop."

11238,5,N,Toys,B00IVDVX86,Fisher-Price Power Wheels Hot Wheels Jeep Wrangler,Probably the Best Thing Ever For Young Boys,"I can't think of anything more fun as a young boy than driving around in a Jeep of my own and if my nephews' reaction to the Fisher-Price Hot Wheels Jeep Wrangler is any indication, they agree. They LOVE (and I mean absolutely without a doubt love) this Jeep more than anything else they have ever played with!<br /><br />The 6-year-old actually helped put it together (the directions were very easy to follow!) though I suggest using a power screw driver. That would have made the assembly much quicker- there are tons of screws used to put it together! It's helpful to have two people to put it together but not absolutely necessary. This is something to consider if you're planning on assembling this Christmas Eve.<br /><br />The 6-year-old is a tall 49&#34; but has no problem fitting in the jeep and he learned very quickly how to switch gears between fast, slow and reverse. His brothers (4 and 2) take turns riding as passengers. The middle one can drive it but he's not as confident and savvy as his older brother so he hasn't done much driving yet- he's content to just ride.<br /><br />The charging process isn't bad at all. You leave the battery in the jeep and unplug the Jeep's power plug and then attach the wall charger plug with the battery still in the jeep. Makes it very easy. We just leave it in the garage and plug it in after every use like they suggest. It runs out of juice after about 1 1/2 -2 hours of constant high-speed driving. I'm actually happy that it requires charging time though or the boys would never want to do anything else.<br /><br />There's a little battery powered radio that plays music with real buttons to push. My little boys love that feature, especially as passengers. It requires AA batteries that aren't included.<br /><br />The Jeep maneuvers very well on the sidewalks and on concrete. It has to work a little harder going through grass but still works okay going up small hills around our neighborhood. One drawback is that it is pretty loud andas the boys want to get out and play as soon as they wake up in the morning I worry that they're waking my neighbors up. No complaints yet though!<br /><br />After about 3 weeks of daily riding it is still in great shape! With 3 boys that is a huge positive in my book and kind of surprising. It's very sturdy and well made.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this Jeep to anyone with kids. They will love it!"

I do at least 2 of these daily now and ALWAYS end with the stretch segment as it flows so easily and feels SO good.  24 stretches in 8 minutes!  It gets my day going.<br /><br />Gosh, I don't know which set I like best.  I feel all of them the next day but in a good way.  I think I have felt fast changes in my arms and abs but I do like the buns and thighs segments as well.  The buns segment does the NINE best glute exercises in 45 seconds each.  Ha!  You WILL sweat!  The instructor shows one way and the two people behind her show intermediate and advanced ways for the exercises so you can take your pick.  The camera person gets an A+ for showing the entire body on these exercises.  The hardest part of any exercise is to START.  This DVD is SO worth it!"

This is the first kitchen scale I have seen with an 11 lb capacity that does not display lbs/oz. For example, I want to see 5 lbs 8 oz. Not 5.5 lbs. I should not have to convert fractions to ounces every time. The only other option is all ounces, but then I have to calculate 16 oz per pound. Yea, it's simple - but it's a pain.

11273,5,N,Video DVD,B005FUTBZA,The Conversation [Blu-ray],A PARANOID CLASSIC,"In 1972 director Francis Ford Coppola made one of the greatest movies ever done THE GODFATHER. Using the clout he developed from that film he made another classic that didn't get near the intention. That movie has just arrived in blu-ray format. Its name is THE CONVERSATION.<br /><br />Gene Hackman stars as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert with a reputation for being able to record anyone, anywhere. The film opens with Harry and his crew recording a conversation between a young couple in an open air park. Using various pieces of equipment from parabolic microphones to microphones hidden in bags they put together each to come up with a conclusive piece of work.<br /><br />But the movie isn't all about this conversation. It's more about Harry himself. As portrayed by Hackman, Harry Caul is a loner, a man without much in his life with the exception of his work. He does have a girlfriend (Teri Garr) that he provides for and sees on occasion. But there is this underlying nagging fear we witness in Caul that has him keeping people at arms length including the people who work for him. Harry Caul is a classic paranoid individual but one who knows how easy it is to gain access to the details in a person's private life. Knowing this means Harry realizes how vulnerable we all truly are and how susceptible each person is to being watched.<br /><br />As the pieces come together on the project Harry is working on he begins to wonder about what he's recording. Filters are used to fine tune each piece, to bring together a comprehensive conversation where no words are distorted or left out. In the past Harry has made a practice of not becoming involved, in not listening to the things he was recording. But as he puts this one together, he begins to worry that perhaps this couple is about to be killed by his employer.<br /><br />When he goes to give the tape to his employer he is first pushed aside by his aide played by a young Harrison Ford. Eventually he meets with the man portrayed by Robert Duval. Paid for his services Harry leaves but still feels concern about what will happen.<br /><br />Going to a trade show of security and surveillance experts, one of Harry's employees is there working on the side with another expert. Bernie Moran (Allan Garfield) is perhaps second only to Caul. But rather than downplay his expertise, he's capitalized on it becoming a major player and manufacturer of electronic surveillance equipment.<br /><br />Eventually Harry is talked into allowing Moran and friends up to the loft he uses where they work. Moran continues to push Harry trying to find out how he did a particular job back east that resulted in the deaths of several people. But the reclusive Harry holds back, acting rather shy with the group. When it's revealed that Moran placed a microphone on Harry in an ink pen, Harry explodes and orders everyone out.<br /><br />Still concerned with the conversation he recorded Harry checks into the hotel where the couple said they would meet. Taking the room next door, he overhears an argument and then witnesses through a frosted pane of glass someone being murdered. Plagued with these images it tears at him.<br /><br />When he tries to confront the man who hired him, Harry is turned away. To give away what happens during the final portion of the film would be akin to telling you who the mother was in PSYCHO.<br /><br />The film is a dive into the mind of a man who peers into the private lives of other and who attempts to not have a private life of his own for fear someone will do the same to him. This lone individual with a conscious is doing unconscionable things, but continues to do so to make a living. It is brilliantly made and perhaps one of Coppola's best films but overlooked by many.<br /><br />Hackman gives an outstanding performance. His role could have been played over the top with rages and flamboyance but instead Harry Caul has more depth in the slow moving actions and scenes that have him doing nothingmore than listening than many actors offer when chewing scenery all around them. His role here should have landed him an Oscar.<br /><br />While the movie was overlooked in many ways for years fans have had the chance to find it as it has been released in formats from VHS to DVD. Now that it's available on blu-ray it is one that should be added to the collection of any die hard movie fan. And if you're a fan of Coppola or Hackman you should be out there picking up a copy as soon as you finish reading this piece."

11281,2,Y,Lawn and Garden,B000SDKGC6,Wire Tek 1001 EasySet Mole Eliminator Trap,No Luck In Georgia,Maybe because the clay soil is like a rock or maybe because my moles have become highly educated but I've not snagged one mole in three weeks. I have tunnels everywhere and holes all over my yard but no dead moles. The trap seems like a good idea and it's well constructed but I don't think it's made for my area of the country. It's difficult as crud to set with the hard soil but once set it has never tripped. I've moved it to different locations but still no luck. The design seems like a good idea so maybe it'll work in your area. I'm going to keep trying and if I get positive results I will correct this review. Not recommended for clay soils.

Around the same time, I kept smelling a great cologne passing people on the sidewalk etc. For some reason I thought it was Calvin Klein, but when I checked at a store, I found I was wrong.<br /><br />Recently, by accident, I sprayed it on a card at a store, but didn't put it down right away when I realized my mistake. After a few moments, I caught another whiff of it. It was great and was the scent I had been trying to find all this time. What good luck. Not only that, but it is available at a good price all over.<br /><br />I got a bottle and use it often. A few sprays and I'm good to go. It lasts and lasts, but it is not overpowering. Great scent. I'm not good at describing scents, but I can say it is one of my favorites. On the heavier side as opposed to something light like citrus, but still not too much. Very masculine.<br /><br />Highly recommended."

Needless to say they were junk when he got done. I picked a set of these up at a local Lowes and I made my son come over and cut a 2X4 to put a top on them for me. Payback! I have had them now for about 2 1/2 years and they are great.<br /><br />My favorite feature is that they fold up and store away and they take up a lot less space in my garage. I used them today and it just reminded me that I needed to post a review on them. They are strong and easy to set up and tear down. It seems like every project I do I get them out and use them.

From jet to fan, I've got it all now.    3 months later with 3 stars:  The adjustment of this brass nozzle became more and more finicky and frustrating.  I don't know what changed.  Everything is clean, the filter screen, the nozzle, the works.  In frustration I ordered the ""Solo 4900654-P Sprayer Elbow Nozzle Assembly Plus Standard Nozzle Assortment"".  Much better.

11335,5,N,Home Entertainment,B00TYFCJ8S,Sony BDPS3500 Blu-ray Player with Wi-Fi (2015 Model),Offers A Lot For The Money,"This is an awesome Blu Ray player.  It has almost everything you would need.  I had no issues connecting to my Actiontec router.  I am on Verizon Fios 50/50 and my streaming quality was very good.  Movies loaded fast on Amazon and Netflix.  The Sony uses the Opera TV store, so even though there are lot of apps available, they are all sort of like misfit apps.  All the good ones are printed on the box.  The main ones are all there.  You get WWE Network, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon., Flixster, Vudu, Youtube, Etc.  There is NO HBO GO or FIOS Mobile TV app.<br /><br />There was a quick update, and initialization.  It took about 10 minutes to set everything up.<br /><br />The Sony is also unique in that it can stream Playstation 3 games via the Playstation Now app.  A subscription is required, and costs about $20 a month for unlimited play on a growing list of 100 games.  You can also rent games daily, but you are better off with the monthly.  They have a lot of good games, such as The Last of Us, Lego Batman, Street Fighter, and more.<br /><br />Games loaded fairly quickly.  Every time you load a game, it does an internet connection to make sure you can stream it.  Once it streams, and you are up and running it feels just like playing on the PS3/PS4.  I could not tell a difference playing on this Blu-ray player with the PS Now app compared to the PS4 in terms of graphic quality.  They both looked similar.  Your PS Now subscription will work with your PS3, PS4, and PS TV also, but you can only stream games on one device at a time.<br /><br />The Dual Shock 4 controller works with this.  However, it MUST be connected via USB in order to work.  There is no Bluetooth compatibility built into the player.  You can also use the Dualshock to control the functions of the player too.<br /><br />The Sony also has miracast capabilities.  I was able to use my Android phone and mirror every time I saw on my screen.  This is awesome because the Opera TV store does NOT have Verizon Fios Mobile TV.  With the miracast function, I can mirror the Fios Mobile on my phone to the Sony.  This allows me to use the Sony as an extra cable TV box.<br /><br />The Sony is small and boxy.  It looks like a miniature PlayStation.  It has the same finish and color.<br /><br />Oh, it also plays Blu-rays.  It loads quickly and is pretty silent.  There is also a small green light to let you know if it is on or off.<br /><br />All in all, this Sony Blu-Ray offers you a lot for the money.  I highly recommend it."

11350,5,Y,Watches,B003U98VHC,Voguestrap Tx83720LBK Allstrap 20Mm Black Long-Length Sport Leather-Contrast Stitch Watchband,Good upgrade for an older favorite sport watch,"The watchband on my [[ASIN:B000FGC4QM old analog sport watch]] had become tattered, so it was time to upgrade it or get rid of the watch. But why trash a perfectly good timepiece that had proven itself to be so reliable since I had purchased it new here back in 2008? As they say, ""It takes a licking and keeps on ticking.""      Started searching for a decent 20mm sports watchband that was reasonably priced and not designed to look [[ASIN:B005BKPS9C too weird]] on my watch, as are some of them. Maybe I'm too conservative, but there were [[ASIN:B002Z367CK some]] that just weren't my style. Contemplated a stainless steel link band, such as this [[ASIN:B001EYVBAY Hadley-Roma Men's 20-mm Stainless Steel Watch Bracelet]], but had to rule it out as I didn't know how it would look on my old favorite watch.      By chance I found this [[ASIN:B003U98VHC AllStrap 20Mm Black Sport Leather-Contrast Stitch Watchband]] and it seemed to be a decent choice, though it was called a long length band in the specs, and I have an average wrist. Still, it's better to have one a bit long than too short, and considering that the price was reasonable, ordered it here. When it arrived a couple of days later (and thanks, Amazon Prime), took it out of the package and looked it over. It did indeed have a 20mm band width, came with a pair of replacement stainless steel spring bars, and easy to see that it was black leather... but it appeared to be a slightly different product from the one here in the photos. The end wasn't pointed as is shown in Voguestrap's product photos, but more of a squared end sport strap similar to that on the [[ASIN:B001F0PTPK Hadley-Roma Men's MSM881XA-200 20-mm Black Oil-Tan Leather Watch Strap]], if their image is correct.      The other thing that was different was that the band is slightly padded, and not flat, and the buckle is not the shiny one as pictured. The one that I received had a brushed steel look, as one can see in the photos that I've posted here.      Allsaid and done, I like this band more than the one that's there in Voguestrap's product photos. But it does serve as a reminder to all of us to check the specs carefully before ordering a product."

11382,4,Y,Video Games,B003O6CB6S,Call of Duty: Ghosts - PC,It's awesome -- but don't expect to run it on your mom's 8-year-old Celeron notebook!,"I really don't know what the reason is for all the hate for this game, but I think it's awesome.  However, I can guarantee you that you're not going to think it's awesome if your PC isn't up to specs.<br /><br />I've been a PC gamer since Wolfenstein, Doom, etc, so I started the COD series with...COD -- the original!  I've bought every COD game since then, and at times, yes, they ran horribly for me, but that was my fault for being a cheapo and not upgrading my system.  Sometimes, you just have priorities in life other than keeping the latest, greatest hardware in your PC, but when that happens you really shouldn't hate on the latest game(s) simply because you have an inadequate system.  Again, i want to emphasize -- I know.  I've been there.  I try to string along my PC hardware as long as I possibly can.  For the last six years I've been using a dual core in a MediaPC case that used to be my homemade DVR before I went with DirecTV.  I wasn't able to play the original Black Ops at all or even World at War.  All the Modern Warefare titles worked at mediocre (or less) settings.  Recently I decided it was time for a long past-due upgrade, so I built a Core i7-4770 based system with 16GB RAM, a GTX 660 w/2GB GDDR5, and Windows 7 x64.  Not the fastest/latest, but not a slouch system by any means.  It plays COD Ghosts at maximum everything video related as if it was a CGI movie.<br /><br />I'm a little disappointed that the solo missions aren't there like in the MW titles, but I haven't really looked into all the multiplayer options, so there may be something in there that will entertain me after the campaign.<br /><br />In regard to all the one-star reviews, I guess I should thank you, as I highly suspect that's why the price was already lowered by $10 for this game when I bought it.  It's simple, folks -- update your system or don't buy the latest and greatest games and expect to play that with a maxed out configuration.  Welcome to PC gaming.  This isn't a gaming console that never needs upgrading.<br /><br />Edit:  They lost a star from me because there are no solo missions other than zombies, which I don't care for at all."
11383,4,N,Beauty,B00A0J0ABK,"Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm, Sensitive Plus 3.4 oz",Welcome relief for the modern man,"Once upon a time, when razors were two disposable blades on the end of a plastic stick and shaving foam was the consistency of the head on a day old glass of beer, after shave balms and lotions were one of my grooming necessities. Over the years, as actual shave product technology improved, I found I had less need to use after shave products. Now that I'm older, and presumably wiser, I have begun to recognize the benefits of soothing and calming the skin after shaving, and have found that a good balm or lotion will do wonders for skin quality and overall appearance. So I welcomed the opportunity to try this Dove post shave balm for men.<br /><br />I don't have a regular shaving routine. Some days I go with [[ASIN:B0032ANCUK Edge Shave Gel, Extra Protection, 7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)]] and my [[ASIN:B001G7PTVQ Gillette Mach3 Disposable, Sensitive, 3-Count (Pack of 2)]], some days [[ASIN:B00A0J086C Axe Shave Gel, Shield, 7 Ounce]] takes the place of the Edge, and some I use my [[ASIN:B005DKKBRY Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men's 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Black/Silver]], maybe wet with gel, but usually dry. It's just how I feel at the moment. I found that this Dove product works fine no matter what shave method I've used, but it was particularly soothing on dry skin after a dry electric shave. A little goes a long way and when massaging it in, you can almost feel like it is soaking into the skin. It is just oily enough to allow it to be spread out across the face, but once the application is complete, it air dries quickly, leaving skin (sounds like a commercial) soft and smooth. The scent is slightly effeminate, I felt, but it isn't particularly strong and doesn't linger very long after application. I used this balm in tandem with [[ASIN:B00A0J09GG Axe Face Hydrator and Post Shave Gel, Chilled, Cooling, 3.3 Ounce]]and I think it leaves my skin just a little less greasy (but the Axe product is fine too). A similar product is the [[ASIN:B009YSSLGE Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Face Lotion]], which I use when I'm going to be out in the sun or on days when I don't shave (which are usually the same day).<br /><br />I really like this Dove post shave product. There's a great chance I will continue using it for the foreseeable future."
11386,4,N,Furniture,B005ETZIMM,"basyx by HON VL103 Mid-Back Leather Executive Task Chair for Office or Computer Desk, Black","Sleek look, upright chair for back support, but this is not an ergonomic chair..","In my old job, we would have to undergo ergonomic training and testing and we were given the best ergonomic seats of the time.  And since then, I have been trying out different chairs that are stylish, not too expensive but most of all, provides comfort and good back support.  If I can find an ergonomic office chair for a low price, I would be happy but most of the time, anything within the $50-$200 range are typically straightforward chairs.<br /><br />This leads me to the latest office chair that I am using in the office...the basyx VL103 by Hon.<br /><br />I.  INSTALLATION<br /><br />Installation was easy.  Actually, I came home and my wife already had put it together and she said it took her less than half an hour.  I did notice that when it came in, the chair came with the original toolset but also came with a newer revised tool-set that was affixed to the top of the box. So, there must have been a revision to this chair.<br /><br />II.  STYLE<br /><br />I love the look of the basyx VL103.  Leather seat (not thick leather), chrome stands and also under the arm rest area and because of the way it looks and it's not all plastic, is probably why it's close to $150 (on Amazon).  It's very sleek and of the several office chairs that I have owned, this is the best looking one that I have had so far.<br /><br />III.  COMFORT & EASE OF USE<br /><br />Upon putting it together, you have one lever that adjusts the up and down movement and there is a tilt tension, so you can pull the lever out and tilt it to become upright and lock or for those who want to adjust the tilt of the chair.  But this is not an ergonomic seat, so you can't adjust the back, nor can you adjust the seat to move it up or curved.  But there is good enough padding on the seat area and really good support for the mid-back.<br /><br />This is important to know because typically, for an office chair around $100 or so, the back seat is not upright and they are not as durable.  This one makes you sit in agood posture and that's what I enjoy about it so far.  Granted, I still want an ergonomic chair that I can always adjust (especially long hours of working) but many of them are expensive.  For this seat at under $150, it's great in mid-back support and having you sit in a straight position.<br /><br />And the caster wheels work good.  I use a mat around my desk area and am able to move freely.<br /><br />IV.  JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />One of the difficult things about purchasing an office chair online is that you want to sit on one before buying.  It's important as all chairs are subjective to the one using it.  But I can say that this is not a cheap chair with mesh backing, nor is it a chair with a flimsy back support.  For it's price and it's style, it's definitely worth it at the under $150 price point.<br /><br />With that being said... For those who suffer from back problems, you probably want to look for an ergonomic seat but you're going to have to pay a little more for it (see [[ASIN:B004LQ1URQ Office Star WorkSmart Professional Dual Function Ergonomic High Back Eco Leather Chair, Black]] or if you want the best and are willing to pay over $500 (see [[ASIN:B003Y5BF7A ErgoHuman Executive Chair with Headrest in Black]]).  Also, note that there are ergonomic chairs sold on Amazon that are cheaper than this chair, but they tend to break easy (the lever or pivots, so beware of cheap ergonomic office chairs).<br /><br />But if you need one that will force you to sit in a good posture but also feels comfortable especially around the mid-back, and most importantly, won't hurt your pocketbook, the basyx VL103 by Hon is worth considering!"

I haven't noticed any particular power drain from this, so I suspect it may be a lesser milliamp pull than a typical wired USB mouse.

11391,5,N,PC,B00FFVYSE8,Dell Venue 7 16 GB Tablet (Android),Great tablet - (I wanted it mine for .cbr files as well as other multimedia demands),"I've been slow to pick up a new tablet after purchasing one a few years back, finding that initial exposure disappointing. A couple of months ago I did get  a new one for my wife, and after playing with hers for a little while I decided I needed one of my own.<br /><br />I'm really, really glad I got this model. I like it enough that I'm going to purchase another as a gift for family. With the holidays fast approaching, it would be a good addition for application use. My mother wants something that streams for shopping and watching videos and for applications like the bible online, and she also wants games. This handles all those well, plus it is easy to  use even if a person isn't so computer savvy.  The device is durable, lightweight, and you can see it well on bright days.I always hated not being able to do that - what's the point otherwise? It loads fast, processes well, and has all the user-friendly features I would want. You can easily access the menus, change settings, place applications or widgets where you want. The picture quality is great, coming in  above my expectations, and the sound is nice. Accessing files from the SD card is easy, with everything loading fairly quickly. When you look at the price, it well surpasses others in the range too.<br /><br />And battery life - that's been good.<br /><br />Battery life has always been a sticking point with others, because they die so easily. This one, with features you can tinker with to save more energy, lasts a good deal longer than I expected. If I play games it burns it faster, but when I'm reading in the day or travelling and wanting to use it, it holds up well. The device charges decently fast too, which is pretty nice.<br /><br />One thing I really wanted for myself was something that could easily read .cbr files (comic books) and .pdf files so I could carry them on the go. I have a Kindle but  Kindles have an issue with that; they put borders around comics if you convert them yourself, making it tiny. Even when you add applications, they have yet to handle it well. This does a great job with them. I use Comicrack since I've used them for a long time and Foxit PDF for my PDF files; there are other programs but these do a great job.<br /><br />Very pleased with this item!"

My spouse lost the original 18k gold wedding band that I had designed for him (lost in the depths of a sand volleyball court); he lost the 14k replacement I bought for him after that; and he lost the 10k replacement's replacement that I made HIM buy.<br /><br />No watches. No necklaces. He's just not that guy.<br /><br />Our teenage son takes after his dad...<br /><br />But these rings from King Will look like stuff they both wear, looks like they could have been made from the metals in the tools and car parts they play with, so I got one to test the waters and he loved it. Am very glad that I did, and now we are back for a couple more.<br /><br />This particular ring is classy looking, though much more like a traditional wedding band in shape, color and design. Still, it is different enough that he is not complaining about it and even says that it looks nice. so far the King will ring that he likes the best is ([[ASIN:B00F0HFQO8 King Will Men's Tungsten Black Carbon Fiber Inlay]]), but they all look great on him.<br /><br />Awesome band-style look. Smoothed edges for comfort. Nice hefty weight (about 16 grams or about 6/10ths of an ounce, per our postal scale). I like this ring and I like it on him.<br /><br />As an aside, the gift box is one of the nicest little boxes I have seen so I will be keeping it for use with my own rings.<br /><br />While the Amazon listing notes that this ring is covered by a ""100% Money Back within 14 days Guarantee"", the ring comes with a ""Service Commitment Card"" that notes ""Happy customers mean the world to us"" while providing an email address and telephone number to call if there are any problems, promising ""a full refund or exchange for a new one"". To us, that is an excellent commitment to customer satisfaction that we hope never to need to use... but if we do, I would return to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive this awesome ring gratis from the seller and, after trying it, my husband is no longer objective about it at all... he really likes the rings from this company. My statements here reflect that testing and his sentiment.<br /><br />If you are looking for a ring for your guy, one of this color, price, style and construction, then this ring might be exactly what you are looking for based on my experience with it.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Go for it."
11394,5,N,Toys,B00BG8F0NC,Monopoly Empire Game,The Empire is Back,"If the classic game of Monopoly seemed to take too long, then you will appreciate this newer, shorter version. Instead of B&O Railroad, it is updated with businesses and brands like Spotify, ebay, Intel, Xbox, McDonalds and Coke. Instead of zipping around the board with an iron or a dog, you have a choice of a gold token like a coke bottle, game control, French fries, and motorcycle among others.<br /><br />You choose your token, roll the dice and start buying brands, add brands to your tower, and buy and trade and take over brands with empire cards.  First to the top of the tower wins. The game board reminds me of Times Square in appearance a bit.<br /><br />Contents include: 4 towers for up to four players, 6 tokens, 30 billboard tiles, 6 office tiles, 14 chance cards, 14 empire cards, money pack, 2 dice and the game guide.  I like this shorter, express version.  I used to call the classic version Monotony, partially because my brother always beat me at it because I virtuously would save all of my $$$ and he would spend his buying up all of the real estate in the first half of the game.  In the second half, I would just go around the board and pay him rent for hours on end until I ran out of $$$.  Not a good strategy on my part.<br /><br />I think this new version will be a hit for families who want a quick, fun game for family game night.  It has current, relevant brands which is fun.  And not all of the brands are about material consumption: there's ebay which is great for selling and recycling, and spotify which is about listening to good music for free - although they may charge a nominal price down the road.<br /><br />While it involves luck more than strategy, some of my favorite games as a child involved luck: Chutes and Ladders, Candyland, Parcheesi etc.  This is just a fun, light game for families to enjoy.  When my son comes home for the weekend - he was a board game designer and now video game designer - will get his opinion and let you know what he thinks."

11444,4,N,Toys,B00KNT6QG0,LeapFrog Learning Game Letter Factory Adventures: The Rainforest (for LeapPad tablets and LeapsterGS),A lecture/quiz disguised as a platform video game.,"There have been many attempts to create educational &#34;games&#34; over the years. During the early days of home computing, most kids saw right through this (though I admit to quite enjoying Where in the World is Carmen San Diego before realizing it was teaching me stuff). Beyond those early days, I have very little exposure to learning games, but like many parents, I feel better with my child running &#34;educational&#34; software rather than midless space shooters. With that in mind, here are my impressions of this LeapFrog title...<br /><br />Last year, I got my then-3 year old son a LeapPad 2, and earlier this year I got to upgrade him to a LeapPad 3 so we could review it for Amazon. Since then, he has accumulated a small variety of cartridges for it, and he spends time on his &#34;green iPad.&#34; He still prefers to watch YouTube toy review videos on his mom's real iPad, though.<br /><br />For his 4th birthday, he received a new Thomas the Tank Engine playset and this Rainforest cartridge. He was thrilled at the new Thomas set, but I managed to get him to spend a bit of time with the LeapPad. The game spends some time with cute animations an narrations explaining what it is about. He was not in the mindset to focus on all the talking and was trying to skip through them. Once the actual game began, it appeared to be a platform-style game. My son has not become video game obsessed yet (he still prefers real world play), so I helped him a bit with basic controls. The character walked through the rainforest until it touches an animal. Then, icons come up and dialog plays describing attributes of different types of animals. It then asks the player to choose what type of animal they just found. It followed up with a similar thing about types of feed (webbed, bird claws, etc.) and asks about that. At least in the first stage, it appeared to be a simple &#34;I'll tell you something, then ask you a question&#34; quiz program, disguised as a platform game.<br /><br />Ithought it was neat (though as a child, I would have found it a very un-fun video game, but certainly a more entertaining educational title). My son, however, soon went back to moving toy trains around his new multi-level playset. I expect he will revisit this title in coming months/years (it has a good age range), but it is clear that right now, video games won't pull him away from the Island of Sodor.<br /><br />I don't find anything particular bad about this title, and it seems an entertaining way to learn about animals and such. I suppose if you child is more in to rainforest stuff than trains, they would find this far more interesting."
11447,5,N,Video DVD,B0007TKNDS,Harper Valley P.T.A.,Jeannie Gets Crazy,"The song was dirty. This movie is based on the song. This comedy features the scorching hot looking Barbara Eden(I Dream of Jeannie) playing the role of a single mom living with her daughter in a town that they just moved into. She is treated unfairly by the local women becauseof her obvious good looks. The PTA threatens to expel her daughter from school if she does not leave town. Stella, played by Barbara Eden, has a friend named Alice and they have different plans. What happens next is hilarious! There is nothing too sexual in this film but, once again, Barbara Eden is one...hot...mama."

The musical accompaniment is sweet, helps with practice to keep in time and key. So many presets, likely several will be good for anyone's individual tastes.<br /><br />Cons: It's not a guitar, so think of it as the unique device that it is, and you'll be happy with it. The muting bar at the base of the strings doesn't always work, although I'm sure this can be tweaked.<br />Batteries: about 5 hours of playing time for each 4 AA battery set. Seems a bit expensive. They could have made it use much less juice by auto-light dimming. Engineers can't foresee everything...<br /><br />Construction: I think 10:1 this is built in China. Oh... where to begin. The first one I had was with major issues. The CPU somehow was not operating, or the control board, and the device would reset during play, or not stay on one preset. Amazon was good enough to send me another one. Alas, this one has issues too. The whammy bar is a bit wobbly, and it can easily be activated even when it is not desired. I know this because the last one had a whammy bar you could set perpendicular to the device, and it would not activate at all. I'm debating whether to take it off permanently, or just return the device and forget about it. That said, I love the idea behind this device, it is an ideal. Although their manufacturing process seems to have quality issues. You might get one that has no issues. If you do, I'm happy for you."
11452,4,N,Video DVD,B002KLQ2Y0,Franklyn [Blu-ray],"If you believe in something strongly enough, who's to say if it's real or not?","Revolving around four lost souls and set in two parallel worlds, Franklyn certainly isn't the Dark City/superhero movie it was rather misleadingly sold as but a rather more ambitious variation on that old arthouse favourite, the apparent strangers who are gradually drawn to the same place and event that will impact differently on each of their lives. There's probably no more to it than meets the eye, but Gerald McMorrow moves and shoots his pieces so well that it's surprisingly satisfying to see them come together. If anything, despite its impressively designed if sparingly used fantasy scenes, the film is probably more influenced by Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire with its hints of people, possibly real, possibly not, who come into your life at the right time and then fade away.<br /><br />Eva Green is a troubled performance artist whose art project is built around filming her meticulously planned suicide attempts; Bernard Hill a church warden searching London for his missing son; Sam Riley an incurable romantic just jilted at the altar yet again and searching for his childhood sweetheart; and Ryan Philippe a masked atheist in a city of religious fanatics seeking revenge on the cult leader who killed a girl he was hired to protect. Gradually stories and actors (though not their roles) start to overlap, fantasies punctured and old wounds reopened or cauterised. Think about it too much and you'll probably be way ahead of the filmmakers, but go with the film at its own pace and it's surprisingly rewarding. McMurrow has a real visual sense that too few British filmmakers have: it's not just empty style or good looking shots for the sake of being good looking but in service of the story, characters and ideas. Those ideas may not be particularly deep or profound - ultimately little more than the need to acknowledge reality, however painful, rather than hiding in fantasy before you can move on - but they're delivered with sincerity and imagination and, with the partial exception of Riley's rather typically milquetoast turn, convincingly played.<br /><br />It'd be stretching it to say that Franklyn is a great film, but it is a great and encouraging directorial debut. It'll be interesting to see what McMorrow comes up with next.<br /><br />The Blu Ray has a decent selection of extras for a film that made so little impression at the box-office, including making of featurette and deleted scenes but not, sadly, McMorrow's 2002 short Thespian X which inspired the film."

11460,2,N,Home Entertainment,B0058GK55Q,Logitech 960-000793 Digital Device - Black (Discontinued by Manufacturer),Not Impressed,"Personally I did not care for this camera when combined with my compatible Panasonic TV. Quite simply the quality was terrible. I stream other video content on my TV but when talking to my brother in Japan, the video quality was just terrible. I realize this is more a function of the TV, not the camera, but since there's so few models it works with, and I am not about to go out and buy another TV to try it with, this is a big consideration.<br /><br />I also didn't like the wide screen view it uses at all. Great I guess if you have a big family, but my couch is at a distance that I end up being barely visible to the caller. I didn't see an easy way to zoom in or adjust the angle when I am sitting on the floor for instance.<br /><br />Overall, it just didn't give me any benefits over using Skype on my iMac or iPad or iPhone, etc. Really the only reason I guess you would get this is if you routinely want to make calls with a large number of people on one camera."

11466,5,Y,Video DVD,B000JBXHZ0,Villisca: Living with a Mystery,A Compelling Documentary About America's Worst Ax-Murder,"This is not a sensational account of the ax-murder of eight innocent people in the town of Villisca, Iowa, in 1912. If you are looking for lurid graphics, you'll have to look elsewhere. This is more the story of a typical, turn-of-the-century rural town.<br /><br />Villisca was a Thornton Wilder ""Our Town"" of a place, but one whose gentle clickety-clack through time got derailed by a bizarre murder. The town's railroad and its comfortingly scheduled passings indeed set the tone for this sober account. However, the train might also have been instrumental in delivering a killer to the Moores' doorstep one dark night.<br /><br />It's strange how some murders, like the Lizzie Borden ax-murders, remain in our collective memory and even become part of our vernacular, our common pool of referenced happenings. Meanwhile, other much more shocking and mysterious murders, such as this one, are forgotten by everyone except local people. Some of the film's commentators speculate on such disparities in sustained interest. This documentary brings the tragedy of Villisca out of the shadows, but in the context of the town's larger life.<br /><br />A number of Villisca locals, children at the time of the murders, appear in this documentary, filmed through the 1990's and early 2000's. These elders give first-hand accounts of the days preceding the murders - and the whirlwind of days that followed it. They talk about the heightened suspicion and prejudice that infected the town, reinforcing laws against members of minority groups being allowed to stay there overnight. They talk about the sequence of people who were suspected of the crime.<br /><br />The killings had some distinctive ritualistic, sexual aspects. So the town's primary suspicions might seem ludicrously misguided to us today. We've been well-informed by CSI shows about the likely psychological profile of such a killer - and that profile hardly fit the man upon whom the town settled their conviction of guilt for a while. It's also hard to understand why a series of similar killings in other towns eventually came to be deemed irrelevant to the Villisca case. However, the elders who appear here tell about the business rivalries and the illicit romances that were tacit common knowledge in 1912 Villisca - and which then got hung out on the clothes lines as what seemed like obvious motives for murder after the fact.<br /><br />These first-hand accounts and the accounts of researchers are generously interspersed with sepia photographs of that 1912 time and place. ""Villisca"" becomes reminiscent of a Ken Burns documentary.<br /><br />There are a lot of good extras on this DVD.  These include two excellent commentaries. The commentary by local researcher-historian Edgar Epperly provides an especially literate, evocative accompaniment to a crime that is at once so far-removed from us, and yet so affecting. This is an intelligent, absorbing film on all levels."

11492,5,N,Beauty,B00NGQYU24,Key Lime Salt Scrub 13oz,luxurious and effective,"I love salt scrubs.  This one is a little pricy but the container is huge so it will last you a long time.  (You really don't need to use salt scrubs every day, anyway.)  I generally only use them on my upper arms, because that's where I'm least happy with my skin, although there's no reason you couldn't use this all over.    It has a lovely citrus (lime) scent.  It separates a little when stored but the container does mention that you should mix it up before using.  Shaking will not be effective -- you'll want something stiff like a knife to stir it, because it's pretty thick. Or just take the shortcut I've been using and try to get a little of the oil and a little of the solid part and mix it in your palm.    I can really feel this working.  One thing to watch out for -- this may sting a bit if you use it right after shaving.  I use it typically at the end of a shower, after shaving under my arms, and if a little salt migrates down there, it can hurt.  So just be careful where/when you apply it.  (It's not bad, but it was somewhat surprising the first time I experienced the sensation, so I thought I would mention it.)    The salt dissolves as you rub this around.  When you rinse it off, there's a bit of residue left over, but this absorbs pretty well into the skin within a few minutes of getting out of the shower.  And it's very moisturizing, even if you don't follow with a lotion.    In the end, I definitely think the appearance of the skin on my upper arms has improved since I started using this.  Plus, I love the smell.  I'm torn as to whether to buy a different scent (so I can try them all) or get the same one again, when I run out."

Everything inside the face is brown, so it's kind of hard to read, especially at night. That's my only real complaint.  It would be nice if it had luminous hands, or a back light (like Timex's ""indiglo"") to compensate for the lack of  clarity.  The watch band is stiff - will take some breaking in, like new shoes. I had a cuff watch band that works beautifully with this watch, making it a striking looking watch. But, again, it would be nice to have greater clarity in the watch face.  I have several Fossil's and they are well made. The vendor did finally get back to me regarding shipping. So, overall - I will give it a 4, but not a 5."

11507,5,N,Camera,B00OKYZ3TA,XSories Big Black Box 2.0 Shockproof Waterproof Storage Case With Customizable Foam Padding (Black),Durable hard shell case is suitable for smaller outfits.,"I transport a lot of electronic equipment for my work, often cross-country. Courtesy of careless baggage handlers and drivers, I have watched my precious equipment thrown to ground from baggage holds, tossed into trunks and simply dropped ‚Äì once into a pool of Philadelphia slush. No harm came to my equipment, though I can‚Äôt say the same of my heart which stopped beating during these incidents. I have come to appreciate hard cases.<br /><br /> Xsories is a new entry into a market dominated by Pelican. Pelican is a premium brand and you pay for its stature. But you get an excellent case.<br /><br /> Xsories offers three cases, all of which are worthy competitors to Pelican and have lower prices for equivalent sizes.<br /><br /> The XSories Big Black Box 2.0 Shockproof Waterproof Storage Case feels as sturdy as a Pelican case. Made of ‚Äú ultra high-impact ABS plastic‚Äù, it doesn‚Äôt flex much when pressed. At some point, I will figure out a kind of torture test like dropping it with an unused camera inside on to a concrete floor. But visually and to the touch, the case feels strong. The latches are positive and there is a hasp for a lock. The case may also be fitted with a strap which is a definite advantage over any of my Pelican cases. There is also a grip handle.<br /><br /> The inside of the Big Black Box is not particularly commodious, measuring about 10 x 7 x 3 inside.<br /><br /> The interior is fitted with a foam insert that has been pre-cut into small cubes. You just pluck out the cubes to create a space shaped to fit your components. This means putting some effort into designing your inside to get maximum utility from the space. There is a foam layer on the bottom of the case and inside the lid. Your equipment inside is going to be well protected from shock.<br /><br /> This is an all-climate case with an operating range of -40f through +176f. The case is described as ‚Äúwater-proof‚Äù, though I am not sure just what the limits of that claim are. I do know t7hat heavy rain and winter slush will probably not penetrate. There is also an air pressure compensation valve, though I have never knowingly used this feature on a case.<br /><br /> Overall, Xsories has created a very worthy and less expensive competitor to Pelican and other ‚Äúpremium‚Äù brands, though you might want to consider the next step up in their line, the ‚ÄúHuge Black Box‚Äù which offers more interior space. It all depends on your needs. The ‚ÄúBig Black Box‚Äù weighs less than 2 pounds, the ‚ÄúHuge Black Box‚Äù weighs slightly over 4 pounds, which is also a considceration.<br /><br /> I like this case. So far I think it compares very well to the more expensive Pelican.<br /><br />Jerry"

11522,5,N,Video DVD,B000QUEQ6S,Crocodile Dundee Triple Feature (Crocodile Dundee / Crocodile Dundee II / Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles),The Entire Crocodile Dundee Series,"The CROCODILE DUNDEE TRIPLE FEATURE is a triple feature movie set that contains all three of the Crocodile Dundee movies in one volume.<br /><br />Although he was a fairly well known tv star in Australia, Paul Hogan was a virtual unknown in the United States. Then, in 1986, along came CROCODILE DUNDEE and Hogan became a huge international movie star who also helped make Australia a dream vacation destination for millions of Americans.<br /><br />Hogan stars in the movie as Mick Dundee, a part Aborigine crocodile hunter who doesn‚Äôt hunt for fun. Sue Charlton (Linda Kozlowski) is a New York journalist on assignment in Australia. Before coming back home she‚Äôs trying to track down a local man from the very small town of Walkabout Creek who supposedly had part of his leg bit off by a croc, but managed to survive and crawled out of the Outback several days later. She eventually meets the man who the story is about and he agrees to take her on a journey to retrace the steps of that episode. This leads to some hilarious moments in the Australian wild with Sue, but the story takes an even more interesting turn when Mick agrees to accompany Sue to New York City where he explores the urban jungle.<br /><br />Hogan was not only the star of the movie, but he also created the story and co-wrote the screenplay. The chemistry between himself and Kozlowski is exceptional and it really came as no surprise that the two eventually ended up in a very long term real-life romance with each other.<br /><br />CROCODILE DUNDEE was a major surprise hit when it first was released. Other than some 1980s fashions with Sue and the people in New York, the film remains fresh and vibrant a quarter of a century after it first came out. The movie has a great, well-written story with some very colorful characters and some good actors who have some amazing on-screen chemistry. There are some really funny lines that became catch phrases of the time (‚ÄúYou call that a knife?‚Äù), but there is also humor that works on several different levels from classic slapstick to wry and witty. Also, although there are a few adult references, CROCODILE DUNDEE is basically a family film. It was rated PG-13 in 1986, but is only a PG movie by today‚Äôs standards.<br /><br />Although the movie might not be a critical darling, CROCODILE DUNDEE was a huge popular success that remains fresh and relevant today and offers something for everyone in a family to enjoy.<br /><br />It's rare that a sequel (not part of a planned series of films) lives up to the original film; sequels almost always aren't as good as the original films they follow. CROCODILE DUNDEE II is one of those few sequels that's just as good as the original and, in some ways, is an even better film. The movie begins in New York City. Although he has been in New York City for a while, Mic (Paul Hogan) is still ignorant of city life. Sue's (Linda Kozlowski) writing career is bigger than ever. One day Sue receives some photographs from her ex-husband Bob that depict the murder of a man at the hands of the lead of a Colombian drug cartel. Her life is in immediate danger and she ends up getting kidnapped. Mic rescues her, but knows the danger isn't over and that the criminals will not stop. So, Mic takes Sue with him back to Australia so he can protect her and fight off the drug lords on his own turf.<br /><br />CROCODILE DUNDEE II has some humorous moments, but it's a more serious movie than the original. The audience actually gets to see some real character development with Mic and Sue. The first movie was more of a comedy with some romance thrown in; the romance actually wasn't the main focal point of the story. CROCODILE DUNDEE II is more of an action-adventure movie with a good dose of comedy that's actually tied together by a love story; the relationship between Mic and Sue is the catalyst for most of the plot. I actually enjoyed the more serious tone of the picture and found it gave it a bit of gravitas that the first movie never really had.<br /><br />I first saw CROCODILE DUNDEE II in a movie theatre as a kid and I remember thinking even then how good of a sequel it was. I've seen both films several times since then and my impression of CROCODILE DUNDEE II has not changed: it's a great sequel to a classic 80s movie that remains as memorable now as it did when I first saw it.<br /><br />CROCODILE DUNDEE II is a great sequel and follow-up film to CROCODILE DUNDEE. It's got a good plot and finds the right balance between comedy and action-adventure.<br /><br />The third movie in this triple feature is CROCODILE DUNDEE IN LOS ANGELES. After thirteen years in limbo, Mick &#34;Crocodile&#34; Dundee is back. This was a really enjoyable movie that everyone in my family enjoyed watching. The picture provides lots of laughs and the story works rather well.<br /><br />Mick and the love of his life, Sue, have a son together and are living in Mick's home territory of the Australian Outback. However, a publisher at a Los Angeles newspaper that Sue's father owns suddenly dies and her father temporarily offers her the position until a permanent replacement can be found. Surprisingly, Mick agrees and they move to LA. Once there, Sue begins to investigate the sudden death of the previous publisher and Mick goes undercover at a movie studio.<br /><br />The critics blasted this film, but like many of the movies they review, they are way off target. The film is funny and family oriented. The plot is more believable than many big budgeted affairs and there is very little violence and no sleaze. The only major drawback about the movie is that it has been thirteen years since the last Crocodile Dundee film. Still, the movie fits well within the trilogy. Overall CROCODILE DUNDEE IN LOS ANGELES is a delightful movie that the entire family can enjoy.<br /><br />Although the Crocodile Dundee movies aren't really a trilogy (they are more like two movies that work really well together and then a third movie epilogue), it‚Äôs great to find a DVD set that has all three of these movies together in one package."

This is a story about the ‚Äúmissing Amy,‚Äù which is dark, twisted and unpredictable. I am not saying this is one of the greatest mysteries ever filmed. It simply is not, because the script is, if scrutinized closely, full of illogical things. Still, it is darkly entertaining enough to forget these plot holes, thanks to the slick direction and fine acting.<br /><br />The story starts with Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck), whose beautiful wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) goes missing. The police investigation starts, followed by heavy press coverage. The Nick slowly realizes that despite their five-year marriage, he knew so little about his wife. Not only that; people start to think that Nick is not what he seems.<br /><br />So what really happened? ‚ÄúGone Girl‚Äù takes time in unfolding its complicated story, and maybe too much time. (It runs about 150 minutes.) But don‚Äôt ever expect something like ‚ÄúZodiac,‚Äù or a mystery based on realism.

11545,4,N,Luggage,B00KQG4XRO,"Casual Canvas Messenger Bag Crossbody Bag Shoulder Bag Sw1079,Black",Stylish,"UPDATE - February 2, 2015    After I wrote my review the manufacturer of this bag had the bag redesigned so that the zipper opening runs the full width of the top of the bag (and then a bit) to allow for easy insertion of your computer.  A copy of the new version landed on my porch yesterday. Kudos for a great response!  (Now if they had only changed that lining!)    ORIGINAL REVIEW    I love the look of this stylish black/dark gray denim [[ASIN:B00QM3BH0G Casual Messenger Crossbody Bag Shoulder Bag]]. Loaded with pockets and zippered compartments, the bag features a diagonal zipper compartment on the top flap and an adjustable strap of heavy duty webbing.  The bag is well constructed of mostly heavy duty materials and features attractive antiqued brass metal fittings.  There are, however, some things that I do not like about this bag.    First, the product page gives the bag's dimensions as 14.8x11.8x4.3 inches and clearly states that the bag will hold a 15 inch laptop.  I know of no way at all that one can fit 15 inches of inflexible material into a space only 14.8 inches long.  Clearly, this must be a typo.  Accordingly, I tested the bag on both my daughter's 14 inch Alienware computer and a 13.3 inch netbook.  The 14 inch Alienware simply would not go into the bag, no matter how we turned it. (The zipper opening is only about 12 inches.)  I did get the netbook into the bag by putting one corner in first and then turning the device, but the case did scrape against the zipper.  Frequently putting the netbook into the bag and removing it would certainly result in a severely marred netbook case.  An iPad does fit adequately.    The exterior of the bag is made of 100% cotton denim, which makes it washable.  The lining, however, is a heavy, brown, not particularly attractive nylon of not-particularly great quality.  The two fabrics have different shrink rates, so while you can in theory wash this bag, you can also expect to find your lining larger than the bag itselfafter you do so.  A cotton fabric would have been much more attractive and easily eliminated that problem.    Grandma's $0.02 - Nice stylish, heavy duty bag."
11547,5,N,Office Products,B00CI6J8KW,Crayola Marker Maker,Fun and Educational,"My 5-year old niece LOVED creating her own markers! Kids 8 and up may not need an adult to help, but under that and an adult may need to help squeeze the ink for the child. Otherwise, children can do most everything else themselves. It's easy to use, and surprisingly not too messy at all. The ink is not washable, so you'll want to put newspaper down just in case the ink drips. Kids can learn about colors in a fresh and unique way. They can mix their own colors with a helpful chart or try their own. Plus, they can create labels on each marker to name their colors whatever they wish. And when supplies are low, you can purchase additional ink or markers separately as needed. The wait time for ink to soak into the marker is only a couple minutes."

No way would I put it on my bed in the condition it was in after removing from the package. It was so wrinkled and messy.. but it ironed easy and hangs very nice on our bed. I can't use a standard skirt as we have a type of platform bed, so this hangs nicely over the rail. I am unable to use the foot section due to our bed style, but you can't tell with our bed as the headboard goes to the ground.

Because of this, I go through a lot of kitty litter and have tried many brands. For the most part, I am very happy with Cat's Pride Fresh and Light Kitty Litter. While this is only twelve pounds of kitty litter as opposed to the fourteen pounds I usually use, there is more than enough litter for a litter box. The litter is easy to pour and pretty much dust free - I didn't see any dust while I was pouring it. The kitty litter has a nice light scent that isn't overwhelming but does a good job of masking odors - my cats use their litter boxes so much that they can get quite smelly at times but with this kitty litter I don't notice any odor at all. The litter is very easy to scoop up after my cats have done their thing, which is great because my cats do their thing a lot! The one thing I don't like is how much litter is ending up outside the litter box. My cats seem to like this litter so I am thinking it might be too light. Whatever the issue is, it means I am vacuuming the room where the litter boxes are twice as often as I have to when using other kitty litter :-("

She couldn't have it at the time because of the absurd price Amazon had it but... thanks to Amazon's independent sellers, we were able to obtain a 'like new' copy which was indeed 'like new' for a fraction of what the game is currently listed at.  To make this short, this game is over in a couple of hours. Our little girl finished it in one evening playing together with a visiting friend. They liked it while it lasted because they could learn what planning a wedding could be like: they had to go to the music store, stationary store, book a venue, visit a boutique an so forth. But... there's not much to do other than picking items from a list while the game keeps track of things done and things to do. Once ready, there's the ceremony where your DS lets you take pictures to share with friends. If a fellow DS owner happens to be nearby, you can exchange wedding gifts with them - and that's okay because, magically, the gifts you give them don't disappear from the inventory. It's all over quickly.  There should be some replay value because there are several preset brides you can work for: lawyer, actress, designer, photographer, veterinarian... and you can do a custom bride but in practice our girl didn't feel like playing it again with a different bride and I don't believe she'll play the game ever again.  If it was for me, I'd give this game a 2 stars for ""I don't like it"" but the person who actually played it said it was 'OK' and that's 3 stars are for."

In this book, the ladies are in space.  Earth's space based defense agency (SWORD) is under attack after Deathbird is rescued.  A crazy group of gene-splicing aliens called the Providian Order have made custom bad guys out of Brood and Skrull warriors. They will stop at nothing to take Deathbird back with them.<br /><br />The Providian Order's minions aren't the only ones hunting Deathbird.  The Shi'ar become unlikely allies of the X-Men as Rachel Grey's family history collides with that of one of Shi'ar counselors.  I was glad to see Rachel's past getting a little more development in these issues because she is a strong character.<br /><br />These issues create a self-contained story, so readers can pick this volume up without reading the prior episode and they won't have to wait until the next installment for the conclusion.  This all-female has a great line up that includes Storm, Psylocke, and Rachel Grey, And the 'all-female' angle seems to promise something different for an X-team.  Unfortunately, the all-female team engages in pretty run-of-the-mill superhero adventures.  That is to say, while the premise of an all-female casts promises something unique, this comic delivers a pretty standard plot.<br /><br />If you like X-Men and especially if you like X-Women, this volume will appeal to you.  There is plenty of action and outer space excitement.  I keep waiting for that 'something special' that really defines a female x-team, but I never quite get it.  I will continue following this series because I really enjoy the characters and the idea behind the group has tremendous promise.  The next adventure for this X-team can be found in [[ASIN:0785197265 X-Men Vol. 5: The Burning World]]"

Pull the diffuser out of the box, fill with water from the measuring cup provided, add 3-4 drops of scented oils (not provided), plug it in, push the button, and presto! --  your house is smelling fantastic!  I had a few friends over right after I got the diffuser and they loved the fact that it changed colors and were instantly intrigued by the design. The device has an auto shutoff (when it runs out of water) as well and you can also adjust it so that it will scent but not have the light. The only thing I do warn about is that unless you are trying to do a quick coverup of your stinky kitchen, perhaps only use 2 drops of oil and be sure to put the machine away from any food.  The first few times I ran the diffuser I set it on the kitchen table and, while eating a quick snack, I found myself being a bit overwhelmed by the scent. After moving it to a different spot and adding a little less oil, I find that it works much better.<br /><br />I love scented products and have used many different types for creating that ambiance and atmosphere throughout my home. This one adds moisture to dry air as well, which is especially great during the winter months. This diffuser would make a lovely gift."

At 95 pounds Harley makes mince meat out of most dog toys in a matter of seconds so we tend to rely on toys made specifically for aggressive chewers such those by Nylabone, Kong, Orbee and a few others.<br /><br />Our younger Bull Dog Elvis is more ""stick crazy"" but Harley has been a natural born soccer player going on eight years. What's especially nice about this ball is due to the deep indentation around the circumference he has no problem carrying it round.<br /><br />Since we took it out of the box a week ago - just like an American express card he rarely leaves home without it!<br /><br />He carries it out side an schleps it back in the house covered with mud which is wonderful when you have white carpet.<br /><br />He snoozes next to it and insists I throw out my back heaving him onto the bed with his beloved Chuck it! clenched in his teeth like a big fat orange stogie.<br /><br />Simply put - he adores it.<br /><br />Surprisingly the ball has held up beautifully. Usually most of the toys we buy for these guys end up looking like road kill in a matter of days. I had some concern over the material not holding up but this is one well made dog toy.<br /><br />It's survived merciless games of tug-O-war between the two dogs and although there are puncture marks neither has been able to rip the ball apart.<br /><br />* Great Design Is Easy For Dogs To Carry<br /><br />* Made Like Iron - Holds Up To Aggressive Chewers<br /><br />* Great Bounce<br /><br />* Solid Rubber Core<br /><br />* Terrific Distance When Kicked<br /><br />* Provides Sensational Exercise<br /><br />* Top Quality Materials<br /><br />* Well Made And Made To Last.<br /><br />In fact I just ordered another one of these and one of the Chuck It!

The size of the over-the-ear loop tends to pull the speaker out of my ear.  I can remove the clip, but I'd prefer my headset not be on the verge of falling to the ground.<br /><br />The on/off switch is small and rigid, but is easy enough to manipulate. The volume button is a single rocker type, but is small enough to be difficult to manipulate consistently.<br /><br />Sound from incoming voice is impressive and I have heard no complaints from the people I've called about the quality of the signal they receive. Though the HK250 is capable of streaming media audio, I'm not impressed by its music acoustic qualities; the feature ranks as mere gimmick on monaural devices, though I applaud the Bluetooth specification which enables it since, being a speaker it may as well play back media audio - it's convenient.<br /><br />My favorite thing about the HK250 is the spoken audible cues; connection status, battery level, the phone number of the incoming calls and a subtle ""double-blip"" which indicates when the call recipient picks up the line.<br /><br />The finish is unappealing. I thought there was a thin, transparent piece of protective plastic to peel off the surface, but there's not. The plastic face readily shows finger smudges.<br /><br />Overall, this is fine for smaller ears. It has exceptional voice quality for an earpiece at its price. It can pair up with multiple devices at the same time. The range is exceptional; the connection remains through several walls, from one side of the house to the backyard at the other end. I can use the charger from another brand of earpiece [the connector that looks like a mini HDMI plug] to charge the HK250 as well."

Is it really as soothing as it claims?  As long as my daughter can't actually see the brightly colored elephant and the toys, it's fine.  But she catches a look at it, and it becomes distracting. I rather wish the rings had been left off and softer colors used.  Back to the white noise... is this really white noise or just static?

Easily Rip Plywood or Other Sheet Material to Your Exact Specifications and Measurements","Easy to set up, works with any saw and rail, makes accurate cuts.","Unless you have a cabinet saw or a panel saw, it can be difficult to make accurate cuts on plywood sheets.  I've tried several jigs, commercial and homemade, none of which have been entirely satisfactory. The Kreg I bought most recently has a very complicated setup, will only cut a foot from the edge, and once set up, you can't swap saws. It wouldn't fit my Porter-Cable trim saw, either. The best jigs are those in which the saw is locked to the track, and can't wander to either side. Most I've seen require a dedicated saw and track, like the DeWalt and the Festool, which run $600 and up. Way up.<br /><br />So here's this inexpensive saw guide that's adaptable to just about any saw, can be attached in minutes, and can be adjusted to fit any rail or reasonable thick straight edge up to 3-1/2&#34; wide, and it costs a faction of the other guides. I mounted my Porter-Cable, clamped my cheap straight edge on a leftover piece of 1/2&#34; ply,  adjusted the plate to fit my straightedge, and did a test cut. Result: No wandering, and a near perfect cut.<br /><br />I've been having my neighborhood lumberyard do my plywood cutting for me, which they do happily and accurately, but the general purpose blade they have mounted on their table saw doesn't leave the cleanest edge. Fine for construction, not so much for cabinetry.  I can make much better finish cuts at home now, using this jig, a pair of sawhorses, and a specialized plywood cutting blade. It's an excellent value."
11659,4,N,Furniture,B003L20OZ0,"Safco Products 3395BL Vue Extended Height Mesh Chair (Optional arms sold separately), Black",Good Office Basic,"Some of the reviews scared me, but the Vue was pleasantly surprising.  It is very similar to the extended height chair that I use with my standing height desk at work.<br /><br />CONSTRUCTION<br /><br />Compared to other office chairs that I've put together, the Vue was a bit simpler because more of it was already attached.  All it takes is shoving a few things together and driving some screws.  Easy!<br /><br />BUILD QUALITY<br /><br />While the Vue is not the fanciest chair, it has that industrial feel of office furniture that will last forever.  The metal is thick and the hydraulic element shows no sign of strain when I adjust it.  The metal ring used for the foot rest is very nice and surprisingly slick, though I may just be too used to seeing my nasty corroded one at work.<br /><br />A weak point might be the mesh back, which I could see tearing or fraying at some point because it is just a sheet of fabric.  The cushion also might wear quickly.  I will update my review if I have any issues over time.<br /><br />COMFORT<br /><br />If you've never sat in an extended height chair, it is important to know that the foot rest (metal ring) is adjustable, allowing you to set it to a height that is comfortable and does not cut off leg circulation.  This chair's ring is a standard diameter, which means that the heels rest a bit behind the knees.  I don't know why this is the standard, but a wider ring might be more comfortable.  The metal is nicely rounded, but I find that setting my bare feet on it is not comfortable for long stretches.  This is not an issue for using it at work.<br /><br />The chair itself is firm, but in a good way, with a proper amount of cushion.  The back is nice and the mesh keeps my back cooler in the Summer.  It is not the fancy mesh material that is more springy and supportive, but it works well.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />The Vue is a good standard extended-height office chair.  The build quality is solid, it is simple to use, and generallycomfortable.  It is not likely to make anyone jealous, but it also won't make you jealous of them."

Of course I have any number of racks and trays for that purpose, depending on the meat and its size/weight. Racks don't always hold the meat where I want and they aren't easy to clean up when covered in juices, sauce, and fat that has been burned on over several hours. For a long time, I resorted to using makeshift racks made from folded and stacked aluminum foil, but this can also be sticky and messy, and it is wasteful and tedious.<br /><br />Well, thanks to the roasting laurel, no more piles of foil will be necessary. I tried this right away on my toughest recipe, involving bourbon, brown sugar, and spare ribs (right: sugar, more sugar, and fat). The laurel bends to about any shape needed and then holds that shape, sitting neatly in most any tray. I put it in a foil lined pan, plopped my ribs on top and slathered on the sauce. They were cooked over three hours, turned several times, always adding sauce on top each time. As usual, the drippings and sauces/sugars formed an eighth of an inch deep pool at the bottom of the tray, eventually drying, crusting, and burning to a crisp black. (The ribs turned out great, thank you very much.) After I removed the ribs, I let the tray cool to room temperature. When I went to remove the laurel, it pulled right out from the tray, leaving the blackened sauce and crusted foil behind (with a pretty cool leaf pattern). I started to soak it in water, but most everything floated right off. I was a little annoyed by the large number of nooks and crannies between the leaves and the indentation where the leaves meet the stem, but no scrubbing was necessary - just soapy sponge and even rubbing. I estimate cleaning time of the laurel compared to a typical rack to be about one-fourth as time intensive, and probably one-fiftieth energy intensive. The fact that it didn't get stuck to the sugar and fat hardened to a black tar like coating was impressive enough. This thing is great, and I'm going to get a lot of use out of it. I can't wait to try this during next summer's smoking season!"

We thought they'd be more like a fruity candy, and offer little in the breath freshening department.<br /><br />We had it partially right.<br /><br />These are very fruity, like we thought, but they also do a great job at freshening our breath and making our mouths feel crisp and clean.  Really addictive too. Good thing they're low calorie!<br /><br />The flavor is Big on yum factor, and they have a bit of a tart bite to them; the sort of thing that makes your salivary glands constrict as they react to all the juicy goodness.  *Slurp*  ;op<br /><br />Raspberry & Strawberry Delish<br /><br />They're both really good, but raspberry has the edge- ...again ---> *Slurp*  ;op  *Yummy*<br /><br />Bottom Line -- [[ASIN:B0046HDZR8 Ice Breakers Frost Mints, Wintercool]] is still our fave; intense, refreshing and super-fresh breath.

Of course, make sure it's the right one for your watch!<br /><br />I find it a bit easier to get the pins out (I use a small screwdriver) than to put them back in correctly, but with some patience and persistence it's something anyone can do.  I pull on the band to make sure that it's secure -- there have been times I think I have the pin all way in, but one side is not engaged in the hole and the whole thing comes out."
11677,1,Y,Baby,B002Q0YA4O,"BABYBJORN Smart Potty, Green","Sell, giveaway or just THROW AWAY","I bought this because of the reviews and the name.  I had never seen it in person and if I had I would have never bought it.  I have a boy and the pee shield is very low.  When we first bought it he refused to use it so we just hung onto it. He's had a set back with potty training and I decided to take it out one more try to give it a try.  He used it.  He peed. All. Over. The. Floor.  Luckily I was standing right there to help him, how shall I say-direct-him where he need to go.  But it was too late, he peed down the front of the seat right where I needed to pick it up which mean I either clean it before I empty as well as after I empty it or I get pee on my hand.<br /><br />This seat doesn't have the high seat like the other one does but I think all that will do is cause them to lean back and have a bigger chance of accidents.<br /><br />The non-skid bottom is nice but I don't know of any potty chairs that don't have them.  Not having a lid is a good-bad thing.  We have an extremely small bathroom which means we also need a stool for him to reach the sink, if it had a lid it would take care of having the extra item in the small space.  However, having a lid is just one more step a child has to do when they are bouncing around trying not to go.<br /><br />The potty seat came in an unsealed, plain plastic bag in a the Amazon box only, it did not come in the Babybjorn potty chair box.  I couldn't help but wonder if I received a returned item."

I needed the easy return option just in case, though.<br /><br />At first we were annoyed. My wife commented that the picture looked strange. It was the dreaded ""soap opera effect"", and this TV does not have a specific setting to turn off ""smooth motion.""<br /><br />After some research, I tried setting Game Mode on, and that fixed it. Whew! It was quite unpleasant watching Dark Knight Rises like it was filmed in the As The World Turns studio.<br /><br />Thank goodness for Game Mode, because this is an unbeatable price for its features. A smart TV which lets you use Amazon video, Netflix, Vudu, Hulu Plus, YouTube, some Yahoo stuff, Twitter, Skype (cam needed), FaceBook, MGo, Rhapsody ... no browser, but there is a VGA input. (You'll need to let it update to get all these apps.)<br /><br />And passive 3D, to boot. It may not look as high-res as active - from four or five feet away you may see thin horizontal lines - but it'll do.<br /><br />There are inputs aplenty: 4 HDMI, cable/antenna, component, VGA, ethernet, USB ...<br /><br />Connecting a soundbar: HDMI 1  is the ARC port. That lets you connect a soundbar to it via HDMI and control the volume through it (you can connect the video input directly to another HDMI port on the TV, rather than through the soundbar HDMI IN). If you're connecting a Samsung soundbar (HW-E450, in my case), you need to turn AnyNet+ on for this to work. Go to TV settings, turn CEC ON, System Audio Control ON. Try the Device Discovery. You probably want to go to Audio settings and turn TV speakers OFF. The video may vanish, but just go back and select that input. That should do it!<br /><br />You can adjust backlight settings manually only if you turn off the Ambient Light Sensor in advanced picture settings..<br /><br />Haven't gotten the ideal picture yet ... cinema mode is darker, standard mode seemsto warm, vivid mode gives splotchy faces and skin (darker, pink patches on yellowish skin).<br /><br />Had an issue getting Netflix to play video. Called tech support and they resolved it. I've called them a couple of times and they were actually quite helpful.<br /><br />All told, I think we'll be keeping it.<br /><br />Update: sometimes Netflix fails and it goes nuts - the remote stops working. Try this:<br /><br />1- Power off TV<br />2- Unplug TV from outlet<br />3- Press and hold in the power button on the TV for 30 seconds (while it is unplugged from the wall)<br />4- Release the power button<br />5- Plug in the TV in<br />6- Power on the TV<br /><br />Next:<br /><br />Un pair Remote :<br /><br />1. Press the ""Q""  ""P"" and ""SPACE"" button on remote at the same time for 5 seconds.<br />2.  Take out both batteries.<br />3. Press all the buttons on the remote, one at a time (including the keyboard). (You can skip this step sometimes)<br />4. Put batteries back in.<br />5. Test the remote<br /><br />Re Pair remote :<br />1. Press the Green Button and RED Record button for 10 seconds.<br />2. It should now be paired.<br />3. Test out the remote"

Meaning the Brightech Remix5 has already been dropped several times and it still sounds awesome!<br /><br />I'm looking forward to taking this camping in Yosemite this spring!! The Remix5 is water resistant, not water proof, so it will work if it gets rained on but not so much if it's dropped in the lake or ocean!<br />The Remix5 has output of 5W which is perfect for me, I'm happy with the clear sound, distinct bass and all around great sound.<br />The bottom  of the Remix5 has a small black on and off switch, a micro-USB input for charging, a tiny microphone hole and a small bright blue LED light that lights up when the power is on.<br />Turn on the Remix5 there are five ascending beeps that verify it's ready to pair and pairing is super fast and easy!! Seriously it pairs faster and easier than some of my other speakers! About 10 seconds and the Remix5 speaker was paired with my iPad.<br /><br />BONUS!! There is a hinge flap that folds over this compartment space to cover and protect it from the elements. PERFECT for camping and trips to the beach.  The speaker itself is covered with a bright red screen for great protection.<br />On the outer corner of the Remix5 flush with the black rubber coating are three buttons; play, plus and minus; press the forward button for the next song and minus for the previous song.<br />What's in the box; The Remix5 speaker, a charging cord with the Micro-USB port on one end that splits into two cords; one the USB port for charging and the other a 3.5mm cord for accessing music from another source than Bluetooth. Brighttech also includes a thick rubber wrist strap that can be attached to the device.<br /><br />I received a Remix5 for the purpose of this review. Opinions are 100% my own."

I placed 2 credit cards, driver's license and some cash in it, which all items fit perfectly, but the money started to move around a little and I believe if there was some type of closure a the top it would give me a piece of mind that the cash would fall out.  It appeared that the credit cards and drivers license wouldn't fall out, but cash possible could depending on how its folded within the pouch.  This is a great product regardless, but it would get 5 stars if they come out with a way to fully secure the items you stash."

It's just different!<br /><br />They're easy to clean and absolutely leak-proof, which was why I got these. Sick of cups that leak. I clean all our sippy cups after my kids are done using them. When you let things like milk and juice sit in them (in the bottom of the sink for example) it will absolutely be difficult to get out.<br /><br />But you have that same exact issue with other cups. With straws, lids, pieces in the cup, the holes in the cup itself. Just remember to clean it when they're done. Definitely worth it! I literally packed almost all of our other cups away! No need for anything other than these.<br /><br />No leak, no pieces except the cup and lid. Perfect! Great design. Love that they offer these in 3 sizes! I have had friends get these and they said that their children had a hard time learning to suck the liquid out, just takes practice. Great cup! I recommend this product!"

My music is from my iphone with itunes. The Bob Roberts Society Band by Jimmy Buffett sounds great at full volume, most Kid Rock, Aerosmith and songs do too, but just not as clear.<br /><br /> I love the thick, flat wires, as they tangle less and seem sturdier. And, the speaker seems to work well as folks have been able to hear me clearly. They are not as clear as the iVictory headset but those are about twice the cost.<br /><br />Love that they're waterproof, too. My son has Bose non-waterproof headset and loves these more."

Lets start with the following:<br /><br />1.  Live in a 3500sq ft home with 3 floors.  The router is located on the top floor.  I was concerned that the signal would degrade once I got to the lower levels, but the signal is just as strong as it is on the top floor.<br />2. Home has several walls and thick flooring.  This has not degraded the efficiency of the router.<br />3.  Signal didn't even go down one bar in the basement... The basement people!!!!<br />4.  I even got a signal at my neighbor's house (one bar).. That is a good 150ft away!<br />5.  With our previous router, non of the devices would stay connected to the printer even though it said it saw the network.  This router connected the printer without ANY issues and as a result, all the devices can print seamlessly.<br />6.  There are at least 20 devices (or more) on different operating systems connected to the router at any one time and at least 5 devices that are streaming at any one time and this router still works without a hitch.<br /><br />What is my recommendation?

To change the blade on the Lenox Gold, you extend the blade all the way, then press the slide button to the side. This lowers the internal slots with which the blade interlocks. You slide the blade out and slide a new one in. To access the replacement blades, they are stored inside the case. You simply slide a button/switch and the hinged housing opens. The blades are secured by a spring clip, so they aren't bouncing all over damaging the blades. Overall, the body of the Lenox Gold utility knife is very ergonomic. It fits comfortably in the hand. Paired with the Gold Titanium Edge blades which last longer and you have a winner of a utility knife. Trust me, once you use the Lenox Gold utility knife, you won't want to use any other."

The package is very well thought through and every component worked well.<br /><br />The headphones sound good at every range. The connection with my MP3 player and tablet is solid. The flat cable does not tangle. The total length of the cable is 58"", so if you are plugging it into you desktop computer you have good length to move around and not feel the tug of the cord. The length of the cord from earphone to the Y split is 17"", and the length from the Y-split to the device is 37"". The earphones themselves are 1"" from tip to the end. They stick out a bit out of my ear. In some earphones of this size the earphones do not stay in the ear, but these earphones fit but these don't not pop out unless I brush against something like my hand.<br /><br />The earphones came with 9 tips: 1 foam tip, 5 silicone tips, 1 bi-flange tip, and 1 tri-flange tip. The package also includes an air plane adapter.<br /><br />The 3.5mm plug is gold-plated, frequency range is 20Hz ~ 20kHz, sensitivity is 93 dB at 1 mW.<br /><br />The hard case is 3"" x 3.5"" x 1.75"", it closes with a double zipper and has 2 inside pockets pockets.

11795,3,N,Home Entertainment,B00DQBA4D8,Seiki SE22FR01 22-Inch  1080p 60Hz LED TV (Retro TV),"Well, it's CUTE!","Form:<br /><br />The TV has a red-Formica-chrome  look of the fifties.  I have a black and white kitchen with red accents and I thought the TV would fit right in but ,in actuality , the footprint of the TV is really too big  and looks sort of clunky and the silver plastic legs look a little tacky. There is a hand-hold in the top to make moving it easier.<br /><br />Function:<br /><br />I had never heard of the Seiki brand. I guess I'm a Sony, LG, Samsung snob when it comes to electronics.  The TV was easy to set up ,with on-screen directions ,and the picture really isn't that bad. It just doesn't seem that good for 1080p.  Because of the fixed angle of the screen the off-axis viewing isn't very good.  It has a plethora of connections but no headset connection.  The Yamaha sub-woofer gives better than normal sound for a small set.  Save your order number and Amazon offers thirty days phone support setting up your TV.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />If you're looking for a decorating fashion statement, conversation piece this might be the TV for you. If you're looking for a small TV (with headset connection) for your kitchen ,kids room or dorm room  you  might want to keep looking.<br /><br />note: After re-reading this review I can see I didn't add much helpful information for the TV but everything has been so competently and completely covered I don't know what I could have added.  It would have been helpful it there was a back view of the TV on the product page, showing all the connections, but I'm here to review the TV not the advertising method."

11802,4,N,Grocery,B004Q7H8UI,"Pepperidge Farm Chocolate Chunk Crispy Cookies, Tahoe White Chocolate Macadamia, 7.2-ounce bag (pack of 4)",Great tasting cookies with a cup of coffee!,My wife and I like to have a cup of coffee about midafternoon to relax and enjoy a cookie with it.  We try various types of cookies and Pepperidge Farm is one of the best.  There are 8 cookies in each bag and they taste very good.  Each cookie has 130 calories and 50 of them come from fat.  They also contain 10 sugars.<br /><br />While the cookies are delicious and were crispy and sweet I was disappointed in one simple thing.  Why does the photograph of the cookie on the front of the package have more macadamia nuts than four cookies in the bag?  I rate this as a 5 star cookie that loses one star for false advertising.  Make the photo look like the real cookie in the bag.<br /><br />We purchased ours at a local store for a lot less money. (42% of the price listed here)

The are merely tubes of fabric.  Perhaps this contributes to why they do not stay on very well?<br />- Foot rattles keep coming off.  There is minimal elasticity in the socks and they keep sliding down.  Even over socks they just keep sliding down.  When my son starts moving his feet around the rattles are hanging off or just come off altogether.<br />- Rattles are a bit too quiet.<br />- The wrist rattle cuffs are a bit on the small side.<br />- The foot rattles are a bit on the large side.<br /><br />~CONCLUSION~<br />I think the it is a great concept, but definitely could be executed better.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my son does not really pay attention to any of rattles.  This is strange because he loved looking at and touching similar looking toys.  But he does enjoy chewing on the wrist rattles.<br /><br />I would not recommend these and would recommend spending your ~$20 on something else."
11804,5,N,Beauty,B002CMLH88,"Matrix Biolage Strengthening Conditioner, 33.8-Ounce Bottle (package may vary)",Exceeded my Expectations - shiny and manageable,"The sad fact is my hair, like many women, is thinning and becoming more delicate as I get older. This is an issue in part because I like it at a below-shoulder length (just keeps so many options open for how to wear it).<br /><br />I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that will help my hair be healthier and appear a bit more full. Toward this goal I had been using [[ASIN:B0007NIRUU Nexxus Humectress Conditioner]] for decades, but they changed the formula and now it is terrible.<br /><br />I came across Biolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner while searching for a good replacement for my old-formula [[ASIN:B0007NIRUU Nexxus Humectress]] conditioner and [[ASIN:B00AE07FUE Nexxus Youth Renewal Rejuvenating Shampoo]] (which had a scent I didn't like and led to a strange incident covered in that review).  I replaced the shampoo with [[ASIN:B003V2P32Y Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo]] which seems a set with Fortetherapie conditioner.<br /><br />I've tried several other conditioners that were not really satisfactory and some just not acceptable.  Fortetherapie was like a breath of fresh air and left my hair feeling very nice. The scent is very mild and sort of like bamboo. It is almost no scent which pleases me.<br /><br />With my below shoulder hair I used dollop about between the size of a nickel and a quarter then rub my hands together and work it throughout my hair. This amount seems to work well and helps make it easier to get my shower comb through my wet hair. It's not really a detangling conditioner for me, but it helps a lot and that is plenty good for me.<br /><br />Rinsing it out takes longer than I expected. Hotter water helps clear it faster but too-hot may not be good for hair or scalp. I'm slowly trying to use less and less till I hit the right balance.<br /><br />The bottom line is using [[ASIN:B003V2P32Y Matrix Biolage Strengthening Shampoo]] and Fortetherapie Strenthening conditioner is leaving my hair and scalp feeling and looking better than I expected. My hair looks and feels clean longer and is very manageable.<br /><br />I'll update the review with observations about the ""strengthening"" properties as I live with Fortetherapie conditioner longer.<br /><br />First impressions are very positive and hopeful. I hope this will be helpful, especially for those of us who loved the original formula Nexxus Humectress conditioner.<br /><br />Update: Jan 9 2014<br />Because of the rinsing issue I mentioned in the main review I have been using less and less of the Biolage conditioner each shampoo. I'm now using about half what I started with and it rinses easier and my hair looks and feels at least as nice.<br /><br />What I'm using now seems less than what I would have thought would be effective. But happy surprise: it's like getting twice as many shampoos for the same money. It seems like my Biolage conditioner keeps getting better and better.<br /><br />Update: Feb 15 2015<br /><br />I think I'm using a little less than in the January update. A little less than a rounded nickel sized blob. This seems about right for my below shoulder length hair. I also can risse this amount more easily without resorting to very hot water. After a couple of months I feel my hair is either stronger or less likely to tangle and break. Whatever the case I got the same positive result.<br /><br />Matrix Biolage Strengthening conditioner exceeds my original expectation even more now."

Granted, 10 pounds is not that much weight for the upper body, but it makes a big difference for things like climbing stairs and practicing MMA.<br /><br />The inside has enough padding to prevent the 10 pounds of weights (20 half pounds) from creating discomfort.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of people, I do not believe in using this for basketball because it just puts more torque on the knees."

11818,4,N,Sports,B00NQWTQTA,iPong Mini Table Tennis Trainer Robot,"Cool, fun and simple for $40...but you may want to look towards the iPong Topspin Training Robot (for the same price) instead...","When it comes to Table Tennis Training Robots, iPong is known for the various products.<br /><br />Of course, the products can go anywhere from $40 to over a $100 but for those wanting a cheaper alternative may want to give the iPong Mini Ball holder a chance.<br /><br />For its pricepoint, it's not going to hold over a 100 balls (it holds 20), no accessories or special spins, but still the iPong Mini Ball holder is great for its simple use and that is for people who want to train when it comes to aiming and targeting their shots.<br /><br />The iPong Mini Ball Holder takes four AA batteries  - Note that the battery tray is held by a screw, takes 40mm (not 38mm) Ping Pong Balls and put 20 in there and turn the power on and you're ready to go.<br /><br />Balls are consistent and it's a lot of fun to play and use and see if you can land a ball on the top opening.<br /><br />Again, this is great for simplicity but if you want more of a challenge, check out the iPong Topspin Table Tennis Training Robot which holds more balls (110), has more features (comes with a remote) and cost the same as the iPong Mini Ball Holder.  It's just that it's flourescent green and not as cool looking as this iPong Mini Ball Holder.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it all comes down to you and your training.  If you want more challenge but more bang for under $40, then definitely go with the iPong Topspin Training Robot, as this iPong Mini Ball Holder may be too simplistic for its price and doesn't hold as many balls.  Personally, I feel that the iPong Mini Ball Holder, should have come with 20 balls and that would have made this holder a must-buy.<br /><br />But on its own... 4/5 stars"

It does have pickup with EQ which does work fairly well. The edges of the frets are a bit rough and could use some smoothing out. The intonation leaves much to be desired but what the heck does one expect for such a low price. There is quite a bit of fret buzz at certain places due to these issues. Overall it is fun to play and did not break my bank for a stand-by, casual use acoustic bass. Would never use for live performance - this simply is not a professional level instrument. But if you are looking to get your feet wet, it will be a decent starter bass. Only problem with it now is that even an inexpensive gig bag type case costs nearly as much as I paid for the bass!"

But because they are so lightweight, they will be great for organizing casual clothes and gear when you are trying to reduce the luggage weight.<br /><br />I have been looking for some packing accessories for an upcoming horseback trip.  Our luggage will have weight restrictions, and everything must be packed into soft-sided duffels. These Uncharted packing cubes will be perfect for organizing some of my stuff within the duffels.  I won't have to dump out the whole duffel just to find my clean socks. These packing cubes are very lightweight, very smooth, and the mesh venting will be nice for letting the contents air out in the tent overnight, without unpacking everything.<br /><br />They seem to be well made with tight stitching and dual direction zippers.  They are much smaller than I expected, though.  The largest one will fit two to three T-shirts.  The smallest one is barely larger than my phone, although it is several inches deep."

11859,3,N,Luggage,B00QFQRKGK,"Lucas Vortex Ultra Lightweight Collection 28 Inch Spinner, Pink, One Size",Cutting it too close.,"I was about to order this item after an exhaustive online search for pink luggage that meets airline standards, and some in-person shopping with a tape measure too.  Last year I bought some listed as conforming but it turns out that it measures 2 inches over the limit before using the expander zippers if one includes the wheels and handles as airlines specify.  That is why I went out with a tap measure.  I found most 28 to 29 inch bags do not conform despite advertised measurements.  This one was no exception.  I found a black one of the same variety to measure, and unless they make an even larger size, this is the same bag.  The mid-size bag comes in just a few inches under the limit but this one goes over.  They did not have the carry on size in the store to measure.<br />I figured I could take the $100 risk that the airline does measure my bags, going each direction, or spend the same money on new bags now and use them multiple times.  I got lucky in a store yesterday so this is now off my list but I wanted to share my experience to warn other buyers who travel by air a lot.

They seem to rust even in mild humidity. I got rained on during a job once and even though I dried them off (on my pant leg), they still rusted like any other tool that had been submerged for two days... I'm fairly certain that these are just bare, possibly heat treated, steel.<br />My lesser gripe is their length. They add about 1&#34; of unnecessary tool. Some might like that, but if I want an extension, I can add an extension, I can't add a reduction :P<br />Still, for $5.25 delivered, I'm happy with these ones.

11896,4,N,Books,1250047994,"In Some Other World, Maybe: A Novel",Both more and less than the sum of its parts,"This is a tough one.  Coming away from this book, I can say that I love Shari Goldhagen's sense of the fragility of relationships and her empathy for often profoundly unsympathetic characters.  This is an author who lives for the cognitive dissonance experienced by all of us as we drift away from and sometimes back towards the people we see ourselves as truly being.  She has an exceptional ear for dialogue, which is probably at the top of my wish list for any writer.    I also feel like this novel must have been rushed to press or simply given up on at some point mid-rewrite.  There are contrivances that reek of coincidence, a science fiction conceit that might have actually paid off more satisfyingly had the author really taken a left turn very literally into another universe or two, and an already much-commented-on bit of weirdness where one character is addressed in the second person for reasons that remain entirely opaque.  If I'm just being dense about this last part, I'm clearly in good company.    And then there's the sex.  It's neither salacious nor gratuitous, but somehow jarring, particularly as concerns the character of Phoebe, who for awhile seems to be well on her way to being a fading-starlet-wannabee-turned-call-girl. There is a payoff of a sort with the setup, but with so many YA (""Young Adult"" genre) elements to this story, it feels somehow out of place, as does another character's very inappropriate youthful tryst with a stepparent. (One that could only have been characterized as abusive had the genders there been switched.)    A further bit of weirdness here is personal to me.  I chose this book for the blurb, which mentioned Orlando, FL, I believe, as well as Chicago (turns out to be more Skokie/Evanston), Los Angeles and Cincinatti.  I'm very familiar with three of these cities and have a passing acquaintance with the fourth.  I was once a teenage sci fi geek.  I realize the mention here is something of a non-sequitor, but I found the author's sense of place to be utterly convincing, and am in a reasonably unique position to know.    ""In Some Other World..."" reflects an eclectic heritage, and a sufficiently schlocky press release might make comparisons to ""The Breakfast Club"", ""The Big Chill"", heck, maybe even ""Galaxy Quest"".  Anyway, the apparent cinematic influences are enough to keep things interesting, so while I was a bit disappointed this time, I'd gladly give this author's work another spin."

11909,4,N,Toys,B0006O3WS2,Hitec 31081S HS-81 Sub Micro Servo,"Reliable, powerful servo, great for small but strong planes (81)","The HS-81 and the counterpart the HS-82MG are great servos for their size and weight class (there's a new 82HB in the works). These are Analog servos, the Digital versions have 4 digit names, so for example the digital version of the HS-82 servo is HS-5082 (there is no digital HS-81). The digital versions have higher resolution and are important to use in critical areas such as tail accuracy on a Helicopter. For most general purpose flying, analog servos work great.<br /><br />I use a lot of servos.  Keeping a dozen planes and gliders in flyable states causes me to continually build, rebuild and evaluate my servos so I write with the experience of many years.  The HS-81 is very popular for ailerons and flaps, when on a budget but honestly I've blown a few out and had better success switching to the HS-82MG servo, it's not much heavier and the metal gears keep the gears from getting ripped out..  One installation issue is that you'll have to watch the servo width depending on your wing thickness to make sure it fits in there.  If your wings are too thin you'll need to move to the HS-65MG/HB versions.<br /><br />This plastic geared servo weighs 16.6 grams and has 2.6kg of torque at 4.8v and 3.0kg of torque at 6.0v.  In general the MG servos are stronger but have a bit more play than the HB or plastic gears do.  Due to these subtle differences, I pick which to use in any given situation based on how the servos will be abused.  For Glider Flaps where the gears are often stripped due to dragging on the ground during the landing, I use the MG servos.  For the more sensitive Ailerons, I prefer the HB servos that maintain tighter gears and thus more accurate control.  For the rudder usually use MG servos on planes with motors, HB on gliders.  On planes with motors, especially 3D planes with large rudders the Prop Wash is significant and the MG servos hold up really well.  I've also blown out plastic servos by bumping the large rudder via hangar rash (aka non-flying accidents).<br /><br />These servos come with a plus shaped control horn attached and then a double and single arm servo in the box.  They also come with four small flanged mounting screws.<br /><br />I'm sure you've seen the lower cost copies out there.  Let me explain why, even though they may be lower in price, it'll be more difficult to use those.<br />1 They have less reliable quality control.  Sometimes whole batches of the off brand servos are bad and once you've got it in your plane they can be a real pain to change out.<br />2 These servos are more accurate, center better and are more precise in their movements.<br />3 Do you use and toss your gear or do you re-use it?  If you re-use things you really want servos that you know you can get parts for .  Hitec sells servo gears, screws, horns etc so you can change broken pieces out as necessary.<br />4 when you need a special longer horn or special piece you know you can get that for your Hitec servos.  That is not the case for many of the after-market servos.<br /><br />I have tried the lower cost servos and over time, it has been proven to me time and time again to stick with the name brands to get the support and parts I need.  Hitec is amazing for their support; I did have one servo act weird in a rudder for me (it would wag with strong prop wash in big 3D moves.  I sent it in to Hitec with a note and they promptly sent me a new one, even though they could not duplicate the issue.<br /><br />4 stars, this is a great servo for a fair price but use MG if you have any worry over the gears holding up at this size."
11910,2,N,Video DVD,B00079Z9W8,Amityville 3-D,Pretty Dull Entry in the Series,"I have to laugh at some of these reviews panning the movie's lack of 3D? Did they not read the product description before purchasing? I guess not, so if anyone is interested let me state right up front: This Movie Is Not In 3-D.<br /><br />I was not looking for 3D, and would've been irritated if I would've have to wear a pair of those red/blue 3D glasses to watch this movie. In general I find 3D annoying even with today's films, and if there is a 2D option available, I'll usually try to view films in that format. &#34;Amityville 3-D&#34; was one of a bunch of 80's flicks that tried to cash in on a resurgence of the 3-D craze; &#34;Friday the 13th III&#34;, &#34;Parasite&#34;, &#34;Comin' at Ya!&#34;, &#34;Jaws III&#34; and a few others made a half hearted attempt, but it just failed to catch on. (....of the bunch, the only film worth your while in that group is &#34;Friday the 13th III&#34;).<br /><br />I really liked the premise of &#34;Amityville 3D&#34;, with Tony Roberts plays a reporter, Jack Baxter, who works for a magazine, traveling around and debunking phony psychics and disproving the supernatural. He's not only a skeptic, but actively disbelieves. He is in the middle of a nasty divorce, but still wants to maintain a relationship with his teenage daughter, (and look for Meg Ryan in an early role as one of the teen's friends).Baxter purchases the Amityville house so that he can move out of his cramped apartment, and begin working on writing a book.When bizarre stuff begins happening around his house, his former assistant claims the house is truly haunted, and that there is some bad juju centered around an old well found down in the basement.<br /><br />This movie is a bit of a slog to get through. It's not horrible, but it is very slow. There are a few laughs found here and there, the unintentional kind, and there is a cool idea buried here, but the movie just flounders, with the &#34;action&#34; coming in the last 10 minutes or so. Only recommended to fanswho want to watch the whole series, otherwise stick with the first two films."
11914,5,N,Books,0062122630,With My Body: A Novel,A Wonderful Woman's Journey into Peace,"The interesting thing is that I just finished reading the 50 Shades trilogy so reading this so quickly afterwards really showcased how superficial the 50 Shades series was and how deep this lovely novel is. 50 Shades is like commercial candy and this book is like a finely made Swiss chocolate.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect when reading this. It began somewhat depressing, a woman feeling trapped in the routine and exhaustion of her married life with kids. Haven't we all felt somewhat downtrodden when our kids are young and we lose our way in cleaning up, feeding, and answering questions?<br /><br />But then it backtracks to her life in the Australian bush and as she begins to grow and blossom into puberty and feeling the power of her own sexuality she reaches out to others to test the power of her new found growth. Naivety puts her in some awkward situations (and as a parent, I found them rather scary) but she is also longing for the returned love of a man as her father has seemingly removed himself from showing signs of love and affection.<br /><br />And then she discovered an old house, seemingly abandoned, that becomes the setting for the biggest change in her life. A time of exploration, blossoming, lessons, love, reflection, growth, turmoil, soul searching and also what often holds her back from living the rest of her life with freedom and abandon.<br /><br />The fact that this is mostly about the relationship (and sexual growth and experimentation) between a young man and a teenage girl is certainly controversial but I don't think it was written to be a political stand on sex with a minor. We never really know her age but since she still has to go back to school at the end of her summer I assumed she was 16 or 17.<br /><br />The writing style is very different than a traditional chapter by chapter story unfolding since we always hear from the first person is snippets of short chapters with very little fill in.<br /><br />What was amazing was how wellit conveys the struggle a woman can go through with sexuality, the power behind it, and the deep emotional feelings that accompany that aspect of a woman. I was really pleased with where the story ended. Just right.<br /><br />It may not be a book for everyone but the writing and intensity of the relationship was beautiful - and heartbreaking."

Many years ago I used this to strip a cabinet top and all it did was make a stinking mess.  I ended up trying it again after all these years on a bureau because of a nearly full can was offered to me by a neighbor.  Well nothing has changed as far as I am concerned.  It still takes a lot more than just a quart can to get anything done, and it is horribly stinky with a lot of work.  I used the whole can and ended up with six good sized rags that were soaked and I still had more than half the bureau to go.  And worst of all, the part that did strip looked like hell anyway when it dried.  I finally finished the job with a good quality lacquer thinner that not only made a lot less mess, but also did the job far more efficiently, and cheaper.  I'll never be using this stuff again.<br /><br />Fiormbys may make some decent oils for the serious cabinet maker, furniture restorer, but as far as this stuff is concerned, nothing has changed from my experience with it years ago.

11978,5,Y,PC,B00IDWFN4U,Corsair Raptor M45-5000 DPI Optical Sensor Gaming Mouse (Raptor M45),Great mouse with a couple caveats.,"What a beautiful mouse. Has everything you will ever need for the average user. This isn't an MMO mouse or anything so don't expect myriad buttons and access to those kinds of features. It does have an extensive macro system though, and the features on the new firmware are pretty decent for this price range. At any rate mouse enthusiasts usually know what their mouses are for.  The side pads as many have said have a sweet feeling sandpaper-like compound... BUT this doesn't last as long as one would like for the thumb position IF you use the mouse a lot. MANY mice today use that decrepit shiny and sticky plastic for where your thumb/pinky finger goes...  The feeling after this compound wears down is akin to a slightly stickier plastic. The plastic itself is hard enough so the feeling is never too annoying; I must stress how important this is, because a soft and sticky plastic for my thumb and other fingers will have me wanting to throw the mouse away nearly immediately. I wish the normal sandpaper feel had been able to keep itself for at least 6 months. But this is still much better than my last mouse in feel and touch. I love the overall design of it.  I'm just grateful they didn't go with that nasty, shiny stuff CM used on my Havoc.   Anyway, I updated firmware and installed software in 2 minutes. While not quite the extensive system of options that CM has, this mouse for the time being has topped my old Havoc which had the aforementioned sticky plastic problem requiring tape. Otherwise I think CM's software is better and allows a lot more functionality with LEDs and a couple other things. What is there is pretty decent and you can tune each axis on the pad and have three different slots for DPI, easily reachable below the scroll wheel. A single, small and red LED light is for the first slot and this goes to three lights. They are pretty low key and not too bright. I shut off the Corsair logo as it was too bright and annoying for my tastes.  I am not sure what thenative specs are on the DPI sensor but I use about 900-1200 on my desktop and it feels about perfect. I certainly don't need much higher. My PC gaming is mostly done with a controller, but scrolling and clicking buttons works great for the games that need it.   As with every mouse make sure it fits your hand. I feel I can put my palm into if I want or just basically finger touch it and the control and ease with how this mouse glides makes mousing fun again (I have been using some dimestore version for the past 10 days). They have a nice supplement of weights if you choose to lower what they have at the factory. I don't mind it right out of the box. Others will want to take a weight or two out.  The roller is also topnotch here and has a metal and rubber design. Still working great after a year of solid work. The materials have held fairly well over this time and I am completely satisfied with the mouse. All in all a homerun for the M45."

12020,5,N,Grocery,B000I07884,"Alwadi Al Akhdar Baba Ghannouge, Eggplant Dip, 12.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)",Surprisingly good,"I purchased a can of this locally on a whim with low expectations since it was in a can. Frankly, I was delightfully surprised by how flavorful it is.<br /><br />To the folks whose reviews claim that this is mis-labeled hummus instead of baba ghanouj - I disagree. Perhaps the confusion comes from the denser consistency of this product. If you follow the directions by adding some olive oil and lemon and thoroughly mixing it in, then the consistency will be that of a well made baba ghanouj. The directions also call for mixing in crushed garlic, which is essential to achieve an authentic flavor. I believe those ingredients were left out of the can and left to the buyer to increase shelf life.<br /><br />After mixing in the lemon juice, olive oil and crushed garlic I also add a pinch of cumin into the mix. Right before serving I will sometimes sprinkle cumin or summac over the top for an added flavor as well as drizzle more olive oil over the top of the baba ghanouj in the serving dish or bowl.<br /><br />There are a few nutritional facts you should take into account: there are about ten servings in a can, and each one contains 180mg of sodium. If you are on a low sodium diet you need to be careful of how much you consume. Also each serving contains 2.5 grams of fat of which a half gram is saturated. This is BEFORE you add olive oil, which will raise the fat content per serving by another 14 grams of fat per tablespoon of oil used when you mix the baba ghanouj. Each of the ten servings is 40 calories before adding in the olive oil, which contains an additional 140 calories per tablespoon.<br /><br />While the above nutritional facts look dismal, bear in mind that they are about par for any properly prepared baba ghanouj - although you can control the sodium content by making this dish from scratch. Although my diet is restrictive I can break the rules occasionally when I want baba ghanouj but am too lazy to make it myself. Used in moderation this is an excellent alternative and one that is authentic if you follow the directions and mix in the missing ingredients and garnish to taste. And it's an inexpensive alternative as well as a convenient one."

12029,5,Y,Video DVD,B0083QJW7A,Shangri-La: Part 2,A Very Entertaining Series With A Decent Cast And Ending,"If you already got the first set to this entertaining and addictive series then the second half is a must, as we see the confrontation build up between self made enemies and greedy conglomerates.  What amazed me was how much I grew to enjoy the series as I watched it more and more throughout the series story, it gives a nice abundance of action,comedy,drama,heartache,tragedy and a touch of romance.  Also the array of endearing cast of characters also made the series very enjoyable throughout the show, as you come to care for some and dislike others which in itself is what makes a great series when you endear yourself to the characters and villains alike.  The animation felt a little reminiscent of a couple of other series Last Exile and Eureka Seven so if you've seen either one you might sense a case of deja vu when you watch the series,also the voice cast did a terrific job in their character roles both for the dubbed and subbed.  The extras aren't much at most just the usual trailers and textless intro/ending songs,  if you already got the first set then you've seen that the case box is just hardened cardboard to fit the two part series dvd cases into which while looking nice isn't anything really special except to a hardcore anime collector fan.  If you're looking for an intriguing series with a entertaining cast and decent storyline here's one worth looking into though still a little pricier then past Funimation sets it's still worth checking out."

I have been searching for a large capacity mp3 style player. I have tried iPod Classic, too small screen for my taste. iPhone 32GB is small for my music/video collection. Having used iPhone 3GS and Nexus One Android 2.1/2.2, I have been thinking of any OS tablet style device. 7"" is excellent for my requirement. While searching I stumbled on Archos 70/101 line and I was amazed they had a 250 GB hard disk model!  Salient points/comments/improvements for Archos 70 250 GB model:    Form factor is great, weight is not an issue. You can definitely see the hard disk spinning/humming slightly on the HD model. Flash model will not have this issue.It would have been great if they have this hybrid model where they have 4 GB and rest Hard disk for storage. This will speed up things definitely. A Optional SDHC card slot like in flash model will be very desirable. Since this is not Google blessed, there is no Android Google marketplace. So one has to install the hack given below in reference section. However this is very easy for people who are used to hacking/computer savvy. It may seem difficult for novice users, but it is very easy. The device/software is definitely not smooth if there are many apps running/lot of data churning. I have reboot it multiple times, but still it does not take away the usefulness of the product. As long as you don't run random apps and try one at a time install/test/remove/keep approach you are fine. When I connected the device to a PC using USB cable, it reboot and then came up and gave option to mount USB. I had no idea why it rebooted. I live with this sort of thing for past 20 years, so it is not a issue for me.  The Music player capability which is my main reason for getting it. There were some bumps in the Updating Multimedia library after copying files. It detected only 900 out of 5000+ files. I did a Reset Multimedia library and it fixed the issue. Took around 0.3 seconds to scan afile. So 6000 files = 6000 * 0.3 /60 = 30 minutes. This is reasonable and ok. Everytime I add music/pictures/videos I may have to run this if it does not incrementally find files. I am not sure how Android indexing media files works. The sound quality is amazing. There are two speakers on either side of tablet in landscape mode. Skype call works and I can make phone calls from this. This is very handy. Youtube is great, playback is good. I have only 802.11g, and wifi connectivity is good. I have powersave set to Overdrive. Gaming experience is great. Angry Birds! I am not playing games involving lot of accelerometer as moving device vigorously will affect hard disk. I am curious how hard disk is caged and sealed to device. Still moving head is a concern. I am not a big gamer of action/arcade games, so it is not a deal breaker for me. My main reason for getting this is storage!  I had all 90GB of music in lala.com and Apple acquired and killed the service.    Accessories: NOOKcolor eBook Pocket case cover, Bluetooth GPS Receivers, Phone for tethering or MiFi make it complete. Case/Google Navigation/Always on mobile. I tether to my Nexus One using portable hotspots which is a froyo feature.  With its limitations it is good. I wish they polish those 20% of areas and make it a good device."

12059,5,N,Video Games,B00G0OYHCW,Nintendo Wii U Deluxe Set: New Super Mario Bros- U and New Super Luigi U,How I Solved My Mario Kart Bundle Problem,"So here was my predicament: I didn't really wanted to have a Wii U. I thought I had grown out of my Nintendo phase. The last Nintendo system I had was the GameCube more than 10 years ago, and I hardly ever played it. Gone were the heyday of my Super Nintendo and Mario Kart, Street Fighter, and Bomberman after-school parties. Then one day while reading up on my video game news, I saw the trailer for the upcoming The Legend of Zelda. I swore I had never seen anything more beautiful, and instantly I was hooked. I don't remember the last time ONE game made me want to buy a game console right away. So I sought out to see which ""set"" I would buy. The standard basic and deluxe sets were out of the question, and I saw this one. Then I read up on the Mario Kart 8 set, which is supposed to be sold for $330. I searched furiously all over the Net for it. I even wrote scathing reviews for those sets on Amazon, because for some reason Amazon doesn't sell them, and worse yet, let those marketplace sellers run their mark-up scams and sell it for over $400. After two weeks and no luck - Walmart, BestBuy, GameStop, and even Toys R' Us didn't have them in stock anymore - I had to resort to buy this set from my local BestBuy.<br /><br />Here is my scenario to give you the best value, as of this writing - July 12, 2014. I have included direct links to the products for quicker access.<br /><br />1) Get this set for $300. Get it from other online stores if you have to. The cheapest Prime seller on here is $305.<br />2) Buy Mario Kart 8 for $49-([[ASIN:B00DC7G2W8 Mario Kart 8 - Nintendo Wii U]]). This game comes with a code to get you one of four free games. Since Pikmin 3-([[ASIN:B0050SWBAE Pikmin 3]]) is the most expensive right now - $50 - save that for the free game.<br />3) If you want the Wii controller that's included in the Mario Kart set, buy Wii U Party for $43-([[ASIN:B00DC7FWRE Wii Party U]]), which includes the controller.<br />4) Buy the ([[ASIN:B002MGPAKU Nintendo Wii Wheelfor Mario Kart (Black) x 2 Bundle]]) for $9.<br /><br />Optional:<br /><br />5) Buy Zelda: Wind Waker HD for about $41-([[ASIN:B002I0GF72 The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD]]). The Wonderful 101 is only $24([[ASIN:B002I08CSW The Wonderful 101]]). Super Mario 3D World is $49-([[ASIN:B00DC7G0GG Super Mario 3D World - Nintendo Wii U]]), and Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze is $44-([[ASIN:B00DC7O77A Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze - Nintendo Wii U]]). All of these games mentioned are the cheapest prices(here on Amazon) for a big online store.<br />6) If you want the Wii U Pro controller, get the Japanese import version, which saves you about $10($40)-([[ASIN:B009AP2518 Wii U PRO controller (shiro) (WUP-A-RSWA)]]). It's the exact same as the US one, only with Japanese documentation.<br /><br />If you do my method, it would cost you $400 for the whole set, which includes Mario Kart 8, Wii U Party, and the Wii controller and wheel add-on. This is $70 more than the Mario Kart set, but then you don't have to wait until who knows when for that set to be available again, plus you gain Super Mario Bros U/Super Luigi U that comes with the Deluxe Set, and Wii U Party, which make up the price difference. You can resell those two extra games if you don't want to keep them. Hope that helps! Good luck!<br /><br />*As of the Wii U itself, I love, Love, LOVE my Wii U! I can finally relive my childhood past. The included Mario/Luigi games bring back the nostalgia of the original Nintendo, only this time the graphics are soooo gorgeous. I can just stare at it all day while a friend plays it. I also bought Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3, and the Wonderful 101, and all have been a joy and a blast to play, each in their unique way. The feeling the Wii U gives you is night and day different than my PS4 or PC. While the other two systems offer the mature entertainment my grown-up phase has moved on to, there will always be a place in my heart for Nintendo games, and the Wii U provides allthat for me, and in spades. Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto was right when he said ""Nintendo"" is its own unique genre. Nowhere else can you get games like the Mario games, Mario Kart, the Yoshi/Toad/Kirby/Donkey Kong games. More importantly, they all have their own unique style and feel that no other games can give you. You can read more about that article at [nintendolife.com/news/2014/06/miyamoto_thinks_that_nintendo_are_in_a_genre_of_their_own]. The closest recent game that can even say to be similar that's available across all systems is Rayman. And then there's the eNintendo shop, which further allows you to play those legacy games in their original state. So far I've bought The Legend of Zelda: a Link to the Past, and The Minish Cap, and both have been awesome to play, and is almost exactly how I remembered it. And finally, there's a rewards system on Club Nintendo where you earn points for registering your games and systems. These points then can be used to redeem for free games. And then, if you reach 300 points, you will be at Gold status, which would earn you further freebies at the end of the Nintendo year (June 30 of each year), and 600 points gets you to Platinum status. I registered my Wii U, Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3, and The Wonderful 101, and I'm already at Gold level! For more info, you can check out [club.nintendo.com/elite-status-gifts.do].<br /><br />If you were holding off on buying a Wii U - like me - well, now is the perfect time to get back into it, especially with Mario Kart just coming out, plus all those great games coming at the end of the year and next year, like the aforementioned upcoming Legend of Zelda.<br /><br />DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!"

Men are planning an action to get funds. Pistols will be needed, if necessary. Johnny got 17 years for gun running until he escaped. Has he changed? ‚ÄúWhen I want your advice I‚Äôll ask for it.‚Äù [Fatal arrogance?] Three men enter the office of a factory to rob the payroll. But Johnny hesitates, an armed man catches him! There is a struggle, shots are fired. Johnny is wounded, the other man is dead. Johnny falls off the car when it makes a fast turn on the street. The police set up a dragnet to catch the robbers. There are excuses and arguments among the robbers. Who is to blame? Johnny McQueen hallucinated in an air raid shelter. A young girl sees him when she retrieves a soccer ball. Elsewhere the other men flee from a police search. They find a house for refuge.<br /><br />A young couple enter the air raid shelter. They don‚Äôt want to get involved with Johnny. Theresa gets information from the two men. [Do they talk too much?] Can they trust her? They leave the house, there is shooting! No survivors. Young boys play and fight in the street. Dennis questions them. [This tell about the boy‚Äôs lives.] Dennis finds Johnny and tells him how to escape after he draws the police away in a dramatic chase. Dennis signals Johnny. [Who was the better leader?] Dennis boards a bus, the police catch him. Elsewhere Johnny is found by two women who have medical training and treat him for his ‚Äúaccident‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhy should I be the one to bring him in?‚Äù Tom has no sympathy for Johnny. Johnny chooses to leave and avoid trouble. The police check the Identity Cards of all adult males. The police search that apartment and ask about Johnny. ‚ÄúHe belongs to the law now.‚Äù<br /><br />Johnny is dropped off at a monuments work yard. A man sees this. Kathleen continues her search. She is being watched by the police. Can Father Tom help? That man has a sick bird,his left wing is hurt. [The talk is symbolic.] ‚ÄúWill faith pay the rent?‚Äù Kathleen wants to take Johnny away, out of the country. [Is that possible?] Can she protect him? Snow falls, Johnny walks into a saloon and is put in a private room. Shell returns to his room, Lukey stops him; he wants to paint Johnny. Shell looks for Johnny and enters that saloon. A scream attracts attention. This saloon closes at 10 PM sharp! Lukey is impressed to get rid of Johnny. Kathleen Sullivan talks to a ship‚Äôs captain about a passenger. Johnny hallucinates again. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs mad.‚Äù Shell leads Johnny outside. Will he stay put? Kathleen runs to find him. ‚ÄúGo back to life, please.‚Äù Men with searchlights approach. Will Kathleen and Johnny go away together? Or will there be a tragic ending?<br /><br />This movie has some interesting characters to pad out this story, but it still runs on too long. Some of the scenes have the lighting that was common to crime movies of the 1940s. Using the viewpoint of the robbers wasn‚Äôt new (‚ÄúThe Asphalt Jungle‚Äù was a better movie). This movie shows life in the tenements of Belfast. They did not explain the sickness of Johnny. Did a brain disease cause his blurred vision and fainting?"

12072,4,Y,Camera,B0084FHWZ4,Metal Lens / Filter Adapter Tube For Nikon Coolpix L810 L820 L830 62mm L-810,The only way to add a filter to a Nikon Coolpix L820,"I am a nature photographer as a hobby to all the hiking I do & I had been wanting a Digital SLR Nikon forever but could never afford to spend that much on a camera, then finally Nikon made a Coolpix L820 model that looks like an SLR, but the lens is fixed to the camera body & the lens also doesn't allow for a filter of any kind, so if your lens gets scratched, it is ruined.<br /><br />So this Metal Lens filter adapter tube allows you to be able to put a polarizer & lens cap, which is exactly what I wanted to do.  This filter adapter tube has tiny pegs which tighten down on the outer part of the lens housing on the camera with simple allen wrenches that is included with the adapter.  The lens adapter ring is metal & durable but it does not mount that tightly to the camera lens, it only connects in 2 points on the sides. I think that if it connected in 4 places that it wouldn't move up & down if you touch it.  I was just not that comfortable cranking down on my new camera with some metal pegs to attach this thing.<br /><br />The adapter ring screws off/on in the middle, so it can be used as a zoom lens tube or widescreen lens tube.  I do love that someone made a 'fix' for Nikons inability to make a threaded end to the lens to affix a polarizing filter, but this gadget is limited to the makings of Nikon and the lens tube will be in the actual shot (photo) if you take a widescreen (zoomed out) shot with the telephoto adapter attachment on the lens.<br /><br />When you have the widescreen (half adapter) attached to the lens, if you zoom out too much, the lens will hit the end of the filter & read an error.  When this happens, all you have to do is turn the camera off & back on.  You just have to get a feel of how to use this & the limitations.  I actually lost the telephoto half of the ring & now have only the widescreen tube, but both tubes equally work with a filter & lens cap of any type (62mm) & I find that this is all I need anyway & that when I zoom into a shot, the lighting is at dusk or dawn or shadows (animals in the wilderness), so the camera actually takes a nice shot without the polarizer on it.<br /><br />So, Yes I am happy to be able to use a polarizer on my new Nikon Coolpix SLR fixed lens, but the constant screwing & unscrewing from telephoto to widescreen was annoying, so I usually only shoot wide, or I take off the filter, leaving the tube on it, then the lens will zoom right through the tube with no problems, so you never have to take it off, just the filter you add.<br /><br />This is more of a situation problem than any problem with this product, except for the way it moves up & down if you bump it with your hand, but it is not a deal breaker."

The dome is large - about 4.5x10&#34;, so it will fit most cakes. Since the entire thing is clear plastic, you really don't want to slice into it. I'd suggest a cardboard disc under whatever you wish to cut.<br /><br />Configuration 2: Simply remove the dome and flip over the base. Now you have a snack tray with bowl for dip. The bowl is removable so you can use your own.<br /><br />Configuration 3: Same as #2, but put the dome over it. Also the most compact storage option.<br /><br />Lots of uses, great for parties.

And thanks to my discovery this year, I can add Hershey's Kisses - Pumpkin Spice to the list.<br /><br />The orange and brown striped wrapper looks just like a normal kiss, and the shape is the same as well.  You‚Äôd certainly never know that these are something different ‚Äì until you unwrap them.  Inside the foil, you‚Äôll find an orange covered kiss.  If you bite into it, you‚Äôll discover a small white chocolate core, but most of the candy is made up of the orangey outside layer.<br /><br />And that‚Äôs a good thing.  These kisses don‚Äôt take much like chocolate but then again white chocolate rarely does.  Instead, they taste just like perfectly spiced pumpkin, and the white chocolate adds a touch of sweetness while letting the pumpkin spice flavor take center stage.  I can pop one in my mouth and taste the delicious cookies or muffins I‚Äôve had in the past.  They melt in your mouth fairly easily, although I find it hard to wait long enough for them to melt.  I‚Äôm chewing and swallowing while unwrapping the next one.<br /><br />Which isn‚Äôt necessarily a good thing since these kisses aren‚Äôt good for you.  9 of these guys have 210 calories, 110 of them from fat.  And there are no nutrients to speak of at all.  What did you expect from candy?<br /><br />This is hardly surprisingly when you take a look at the ingredients.  We've got your sugar, vegetable oil, milk, corn syrup solids, and whey, with less than 2% of a ton of other things that aren't healthy for you either.<br /><br />Hersey‚Äôs makes these in the early fall to coincide with Halloween.  That just might be a good thing.  It gives me something to look forward to and it keeps me from eating too many all year round.<br /><br />So, if you like pumpkin, give the Pumpkin Spice Hershey's Kisses a try.

This knife is light, sharp, very comfortable in the hand, easy to find it if you drop it in the woods, has a nice sheath and as with all of the Bear Grylls products comes with the priorities of survival fold out. So for less than $20 you are getting a lot but for the $40 it cost at Cabellas I would leave it on the shelf. However for $18 if I lose or break it, no big loss. The knife is an excellent cutting tool but does not hold an edge extremely well due to the soft steel used in the BG knives (except for the Bear Grylls Ultimate Pro).  The soft steel does make re-sharpening a breeze though and this knife being half serrated there is always a usable cutting edge on this knife. There is a nice little pocketc inside the sheath for storing the Priorities of Survival fold out. The blade on this knife locks up very tight though I have not tested its strength nor will I. I don't put too much trust in the locks on my Benchmade, ZT's, SOG's, or Cold Steel knives. Locks can break and I can only assume the cheaper the knife is made the more prone it will be to break so I won't tempt my fate with this one by treating it like a fixed blade, I need all my fingers.  All in all it really is quite a nice sheath folder for fishing, day hiking, bug out bag or even a decent EDC knife for those on a tight budget."

12175,5,N,Home Improvement,B00B3SG7F0,"Weller SP40NKUS 40 Watt LED Soldering Iron Kit, Red/Black",I never knew I needed this until I had it in my hands,"This soldering pen makes me want to run around and solder everything in sight. I really love it. I've never soldered a thing in my life before trying this. I needed to repair an electronic item and work on some jewelry bits and this was amazing. I have smallish hands and this felt comfortable - no hand fatigue at all. There are three interchangeable heads (though so far I've only tried one). I will update the review with any issues on the other two as I try them.<br /><br />So, I think this would be a great item for people who work with all kinds of electronics, for hobbyists (the retro H.O. train enthusiast comes to mind), and for various other types of model making. I couldn't say if this has the chops to be a professional soldering iron for use day-after-day-after-day by a professional user but it's wonderful for the hobbyist who works more sporadically.<br /><br />In addition to the three interchangeable heads, Weller provides an iron stand, user manual (which I made very good use of), a soldering aid tool, lead-free solder, and is illuminated with little LED lights to keep the work surface illuminated. I really appreciated the lights - nice touch.<br /><br />From what I've read about Weller, they are a very good company that produces high quality tools. This iron is made in Mexico (I'm one of those folks who reads the labels). While I will use a product made outside of the U.S.A., I'm steadily moving in the direction of purchasing only U.S. made products so I wish it had been made in the U.S.A. (but I'll take Mexico over China any day)."

12205,3,N,Books,0802408796,Before Burnout: Balanced Living for Busy People (Christian living),Don't Get Burned by Following Jesus,"The authors in Before Burnout deal with perfectionistic attitudes and behavior.  It is interesting that Minirth and Meier write so much about perfectionism and burnout, when they freely admit that they themselves are perfectionists or obsessive-compulsive.  This gives the books a personal touch, however, since they sprinkle personal examples throughout their writings.  They describe two kinds of perfectionists: the quality and the quantity characters.  Like their former volume, How to Beat Burnout, the biblical Martha gets the bad rap.  Unlike the former volume, this one contains no references to sources of information and studies cited.  Though this might make for easier reading, the academic might be frustrated, especially when he or she needs more convincing.  Sometimes it appears that the authors characterize just plain Christian spirituality, truth, and accuracy as obsessive-compulsive (OC) (p. 29).  Even Moses gets labeled an OC (p. 52).  They appear to assume that middle-class values, i.e. people who tend to work long hours, are really OCs (p. 61), and even characterize those with a high need for achievement as OCs (p. 68).  Their psychologizing of Calvin's theology (p. 71) reminds me of Erik Erikson's description of Lutheran theology as ""anal repulsive.""  (Luther was sitting on the pot when the doctrine of justification by faith broke through upon him.)  As in the preceding book, idealism, unrealistic expectations, bitterness and forgiveness are primary themes for recovery.  Yet some of their recommendations appear awkward.  They want their clients to choose friendships that will benefit themselves (p. 134), somewhat reversing Christ's command to love our enemies.  And the later chapters of their book appears only loosely tied to OC or perfectionistic behavior."

A stand-alone easy dinner treat.<br /><br />One winter evening my wife and I went out for dinner and decided to pay a visit to a Hard Times Chili parlor. Imagine my surprise when I opened the menu to find three different types of chili. I'm thinking &#34;really, how different can chili recipes be?&#34; I decided to ask our waitress about the differences and she told me about Cincinnati style. The difference being the cinnamon added to the batch.<br /><br />I was so pleased that I tried this style - I LOVE cinnamon. It is one of my favorite spices. So, I dug in with some fresh cornbread and a cold beer and was so pleasantly surprised - I now had a new favorite chili recipe. The problem arose when we moved to a new location and there were no Hard Times cafes in our neighborhood. So I began the hunt for a Cincinnati style chili mix that was as good as Hard Times. After scouring Amazon for other reviews I decided to take a chance on this particular brand. It is SPOT ON to my experience at Hard Times and is a great price. We have made only a small change to the preparation instructions that are supplied with the packets - we cut the amount of water that they recommend adding to the mix by almost half and now have the same taste and consistency that we loved at Hard Times."

NOW they say they're &#34;Made in Romania&#34; ... okay. As for fit, they're kind of hard to get on but once on the size seems right, especially since they leather will stretch. I am planning on wearing a relatively thin sock with them anyway.<br /><br />I'm just wondering, are these supposed to be made in Italy? or Romania? Or Sweden? Am I getting fake shoes?

It has some kind of powerful enzyme that breaks down scum in the pool water.<br /><br />At this account I would scrub these tiles every week and the scum would just come right back as if I never scrubbed the tile line. The customer would constantly complain.<br /><br />I thought I would give ""Pool Perfect"" by Natural Chemistry a shot here as I have used it successfully on less extreme cases. Basically the problem here is that the dogs will swim in this pool every week and the gardener will blow dust and junk into the pool each week with his leaf blower. It really doesn't help that these tiles are light tan in color.<br /><br />So I scrubbed the tiles once again and then I added the ""Pool Perfect."" To be honest I didn't have high expectations at this account. The next week I was surprised to see the tile looking like I just cleaned them. I added two more capfuls of ""Pool Perfect"" and gave it another week. As you can see from the video after three weeks the tile is still looking like I just cleaned them (As of now it has been 5 weeks and the tile still looks great).  So I have been adding the maintenance dose each week now and  haven't had to scrub the tile line. This stuff works amazingly well.<br /><br />If you are interested in the tile brush (it actually attaches to a pole nicely but in this pool the decking overhangs at an angle so it is easier to use it by hand) Here is the make:<br />Purity Pool TSQC Tile Scrubber with Quick Connect<br /><br />It comes with a regular pad but I upgrade to a more coarse one:<br />Purity Pool RPC Replacement Pad for Tile Scrubber, Coarse"

It took my dogs a couple days and a lot of treats to get used to using the steps but now they go up and down them all day.

Cutout needed for Kingpad K70 prox sensor.","Overkill--akin to protection for kids' tablets: That's exactly what's desired here by many. Beware: The purchaser may obtain exactly what they wish to obtain! Proximity sensor for  Kingpad K70 is covered--area at top of this needs tedious cutting out of the thick rubberized material--with scissors or an exacto/box cutter knife: Not an exact fit for K70, yet workable. Universal fit for many PRC-branded 7&#34; tabs. Cutout for USB and mini-HDMI exists, also.<br /><br />I protect the tab further with a screen protector and by putting everything everything into an old durable heavy synth-fabric zipper case, as well. Extreme rubberizing makes this product far heavier and bulkier than it may prove otherwise. Provides great protection--until I find something more suitable. May make pocketing, or even purse usage, somewhat more difficult.<br /><br />I'd prefer something thinner-skinned, also rubberized, which hugs the tablet better: This also is a little loose--never to the point at which the tab ever falls out, though. Somewhat difficult to remove the tab--no biggie. Material is so heavy, pulling it outward in order to remove the tab may prove a little more difficult than need be otherwise--no biggie. (It truly is thick and heavily rubberized--never rigid. It's &#34;springy&#34;--a very good thing.)<br /><br />This makes 7&#34; tabs somewhat more unwieldy, heavy, and bulky--even than before--not a good thing. Inducing further clumsiness, this even makes dropping the tab somewhat more likely. It should protect very well then, though--given that the screen doesn't hit something. Pushing buttons isn't as &#34;tactile&#34; as with thinner-skinned products. (The key moldings for such buttons do exist, though.)<br /><br />Maybe I'll leave &#34;skinning&#34; at this, in the end. Somewhat ambivalent, I feel very confident while handling the tab in its protection. A very safe bet for value 7&#34; tabs, with mini-HDMI....."

12676,3,N,Kitchen,B00452NT2U,Cuisinart GR-WAFP Griddler Waffle Plates,Back in stock soon,"Just so you know, Cuisinart said these will be back in stock May 1st and retail again for $39.99. I went to review and saw these on sale for absurd amounts ($200! Really?!?) and just don't want anyone to have regrets. They work okay but we barely use them. Only once or twice. Glad ours was a gift and not something we paid for out of our own pocket. Certainly not worth more than what you would spend for a dedicated, really good waffle maker. These make thin, square waffles and it takes some time to get the batter mix just right and the amount right where it doesn't run all over the darn thing. Most of the time I whip out my waffle maker instead of bothering because if you are just a teensy bit over, it makes a HUGE mess over the sides and in the drain pan. And if the eggs are too big or small or you add too much seltzer or not enough, it can make the batter too thick or too thin and not cook perfectly. Thinner seems better overall though and you'll have to keep checking but try not to over-check because it won't crisp just right. I just bite my tongue at the mess the husband makes when he tries to ""help"" and pour one while I'm getting kiddo started eating the first one (another reason I take my waffle maker out now! Bit tongue does not go well with waffles. Nor does a massive cleaning job!). Haven't tried a mix with it because generally I like to make our own. I would not trust this to evenly cook if you add blueberries and strawberries (let alone chocolate or nuts). The cooker cycles off and on and so parts around the fruit will be raw or other parts burned. And I only use it with white flour, not whole grains (which we more often use) because I don't think it would cook properly. Even though we're in a small condo and it's a hassle to get out, my big old flip waffle maker (another wedding gift) that has an indicator when the waffles are done has a better overall texture, fluffy insides, crispy outside, pure-pleasure type of finish and is worth taking the time to get out even on busy nights when we just want something quick for a different, fun dinner. I tend to prefer thin waffles too, but the waffle maker really does a better job over this even if they are a thick. Cleaning the plates on this in the dishwasher are easy. The rest of the griddler-thing when it spills over, not so much!"

They're also relatively expensive, especially when I need to replace my old ones. I use the disposable caps now for a few times before throwing them out (which is about once every two weeks). Since there are 100 caps, this will last me a long time. The plastic is thin, but not fragile or delicate, and the band on the edge gives it a good grip around my head. I have not had any troubles with these caps so far. I also deep condition my hair and these are obviously great for that.

This watch is replacing another model of the Pathfinder watch. I paid over 250.00 for the previous watch which required special bands that cost as much as the new Pathfinder watch. The biggest difference is the new one does not have a compass. I don't know why previous reviewers had issues with the weight of the watch being too lite.  This watch looks nice and feels like the weight you would expect from a stainless steel watch. For the price I am very happy with this watch and it looks like I can use a standard band as well. Went swimming with it and it held up fine underwater. Seems to be pretty accurate as well and was giving very similar results as the other Pathfinder wstch right out of the box, no calibration needed. Great watch for 50.00"

12708,3,N,Video DVD,B004IY1AW6,How Do You Know [Blu-ray],First -Movie for those who need to face personal challenges.  Second - Blu-ray transfer no better than DVD,"As a common audience, general appeal movie, ""How Do You Know"" comes up short.  It really isn't designed for the passive viewing audience.  For those struggling with relationship uncertainties and professional choices that require you to step outside your comfort zone, it does a little better.  I believe that's where the appeal rests with this movie.  My wife and I enjoy it because we've been through all the issues the characters face, but it is fun to watch the two main characters in the movie struggle with their own challenges.  The ending (I won't give it away) may fall flat for many, but I believe it is structured to cause you to talk about the movie after it ends about all the possible outcomes.  We've done so and always seem to come up with another future scenario.<br /><br />The quality transfer of the movie to Blu-ray is really no better than a good quality DVD transfer.  It is a 1.85:1 widescreen (non-letterbox) format.  Given the miminal difference in price between the Blu-ray and the DVD, get the Blu-ray.  If it ever becomes more than a couple bucks though, buy the DVD because you won't be sacrificing anything in the image transfer or sound department."

I just opened it up a couple of hours ago, and it is too short for my daughters bed (standard sized twin bed), there is about at least a 4 inch gap between the mattress and her headboard.  The description states this should be 74 inches in length.  Also, it looks so squished on one side, and I sincerely doubt that it will expand fully.  The springs feel super cheap, and you can feel them right through the fabric on top. This may change after another 46 hours, but so far I am extremely disappointed.  If after two days it does not expand in length, or the squished bottom does not expand - I will be returning this, no matter what the cost.  This is a horrible product, beware.  I highly doubt the 5 star reviews are real, as another reviewer pointed out.  I will update in two days (10/31/2014) if my opinion of this mattress changes.  Today is 10/29/2014.  This is the last time I will buy a mattress online ever again.  Amazon is an awesome site, and I am sure they will allow me to return it easily, thank goodness."

It's better than antibiotics for sure, and best of all there are no side effects.<br /><br />I weigh 135 lbs and take two tablets in the morning and one after work (around 5). I take them on an empty stomach, although I don't know if that matters.<br /><br />I also take vitamin a, zinc and a multi vitamin. I wash my face using the [[ASIN:B0016836RY Complete Acne.org Treatment Kit]]. I took the same vitamins and used the same wash before I started Loma Lux and did not see a major difference until going on LL.<br /><br />Loma Lux isn't cheap, but it's worth every penny.

When I initially purchased this product it worked but after eight months it has stopped working. I have tried all of the recommended ideas such as using a different outlet, not using a power strip, making sure they aren't too far apart etc. Once they stopped working I read some of the reviews on Amazon and discovered this product has failed for many people after a short period of time. I contacted the seller, FamilySafe, and they initially offered 30% off the purchase price. Unacceptable since it had completely failed and needed to be replaced within the first year of use.

This was the 2nd time in 4 years, the UN46D6050 went bad, (hhmmm, maybe a lemon? not sure...) so I decided to try something different.<br /><br />Price wise, it was perfect. After taxes, it was $481. About $150 cheaper than a Samsung. The picture quality, is ok. It's not as sharp/clear as a Samsung, even on the HDMI input. My mom isn't real picky about that. She's just happy that her TV is working again. I haven't connected it to the router yet. It's a little too far to make any WiFi connections. When I have more time, I'll run a CAT5e to the TV and see how the SMART TV functions work.<br /><br />Dimensions: (W) 42 1/2&#34; x (H) 27 1/2&#34; x (D) 10&#34; with the Stand<br /><br />So would I recommend this Vizio E48-C2 LED HDTV?

First of all, I put filtered water into the two MUI Color 600ML diffusers I ordered. The instructions say to use tap water, but I don't even drink straight tap water, and I don't like the thought of diffusing chlorine, fluoride, etc. They shut off after about 5 minutes. So, I had to use tap water. I also don't like that the water to EO ratio is so high. By that I mean, the instructions call for 2 drops of oil in a full tank of water. I can hardly smell the oils I'm trying to permeate the house with for both the beautiful aromas as well as the healing powers. On the plus side, they run a long time, and they're sort of interesting looking. I wanted to put them on 24 hour timers, like 30 minutes on, 30 minutes off, but they don't work on timers because once they shut off, they turn back on only when the button is pushed. I contacted the seller about returning them, but since they actually run, I'd have to pay shipping, so I kept them. They're more of a humidifier than an oil diffuser, so I'll probably use them in winter."

This new yellow banana toy is fine; he is just not going crazy over it.  Maybe he is displaying a lot of ""tude"" lately. I think he would like it to wiggle more.

12919,5,Y,Kitchen,B001C0A4VM,WMF 8-Inch Flat Whisk,The right tool for the job,"As a young child I always hated the patches of white in my scrambled eggs.  As with many other things I disliked, I vowed that when I grew up things would change and I would have it my way.  Along the path to maturity I discovered that if you whipped the eggs longer and more vigorously than my mother did, the white patches disappeared and the eggs became fluffy.  Further along the path I discovered physics and came to an understanding that the increased surface area of a whisk provided a mechanical advantage over my mother's tool choice which was a table fork.  One thing led to another and I acquired multiple whisks for various usage.<br /><br />Recently while stirring an individual serving sized cup of plain Greek yogurt with a spoon, I realized that life would be better with a small flat whisk.  Having experience with the WMF brand and liking the dimensions of this tool, I made the purchase.<br /><br />This whisk definitely lives up to my expectations of quality.  I always take care of my tools and I suspect this one will be with me forever.  My yogurt is now totally smooth and shiny with a fraction of the physical effort on my part.  Once again, the use of a more refined tool has distanced me from my primate ancestors."

They come in their own fabric bag, and the only beef I have is that they covered that in plastic. The point of having its own fabric bag is not to have to use a plastic bag. The sheet and the bag are washable, so I don't understand the point of the plastic. Not sure if the manufacturer did that or Amazon added it, but unnecessary waste IMO. Wonderful sheets though and I would purchase again. Will be looking for some in twin size. Wish the Amazon listing would show all available sizes and colors together.    1/17/15 Update: Months of use of these sheets and they are holding up very well.

If you want to see what made the American popular song in pre-Elvis days, listen to the score by two of Broadway's best songwriters, Harry Warren, the Italian guy, and Al Dubin, the Jewish guy. Don't miss the bonus short with Harry Warren at the piano playing some of his many hit songs (while a typical 30's group of singers gather round the piano). Do Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell seem  kind of weak in their roles: the audience loved both through the next years.<br />I can't say I remember seeing it when it was made in 1932, although I was around at the time, but I did see it frequently in the third and fourth run movie houses a few years later. It still enlivens me and I think it will many of you. If nothing else, it will be a compendium of later Hollywood cliches (as well, I should think, of Carol Burnett/Harvey Korman, et al. skits, decades later)."

13103,3,Y,Camera,B002C6QE00,Kenko 1.4X PRO 300 Teleconverter DGX Nikon AF Digital SLRs,Okay for Casual Use,"I'll admit I'm not a huge fan of using TC's generally speaking but my opinion has been based on shooting film from decades ago. I wondered if maybe technology had caught up and if today's tele-converters were better than the ones I remembered. I ordered the Kenko after reading several reviews figuring for the price, I can't get hurt too badly. My experience with the Kenko 1.4x did not impress me. Build quality seemed good. Not great, but good. The TC fit well on my D750 with no discernible &#34;play&#34;. With a lens attached there was a tiny wiggle. The TC works best with Nikon lenses; but this should not be surprising. What was a little surprising was just how bad the image quality was when used in conjunction with a non-Nikon lens. Using the Kenko with my Sigma 50mm f/1.4 Art series lens, for example, was a complete disaster. Used with a Nikon 85mm f/1.8G image sharpness was clearly degraded but still very acceptable. Chromatic aberration was apparent however and that kind of bugged me. Yes, I can remove with Photoshop but I prefer not having it to begin with. Auto-focus generally seemed to &#34;flutter&#34; and struggle a bit, even in full sunlight, but focus-lock did happen. In summary, I'd say this is a pretty mediocre piece of kit. I won't be keeping mine but I'm really picky about my image quality. For more casual shooters, this is probably a nice addition to the bag. For the serious hobbyist or pro shooter, however, I'd have to say the Kenko 1.4x Pro 300 DGX is probably a non-starter."

It's non-glare so the images don't have any distractions from hot spots and I don't have to spend a lot of time in photoshop. It also wipes clean easily...not something I can say for muslin. Working with anyone, the backdrop will get a little dirty from feet to scuffs from light stands. My only complaints would be that it doesn't have a rod pocket. That was easily fixed. I taped the backdrop to the roll it was shipped on. That way I can slide the roll on and off the backdrop stand. It also adds a little extra support because the vinyl is a lot heavier than muslin."

I was expecting this thing to fully mate with car; it does not. Yes, it stays in place and does work but a small wiggle will cause it to stop working. For something that is used VERY little, and its ability to quickly move between cars, its well worth it.  Also, I discovered you cannot get features out of this that Honda restricts. One example is MPG. Honda blocks that data thus will not be displayed. This seems specific to Ridgeline, but is likely true to any other make/model that manufacture does not want these settings known. Ridgeline was blocked because the MPG is so low (< 17) they don't want easy to find.  Just my opinion."

LED's have come a long way in just the last few years and I've equipped my home with quite a few of them by this point.  The gains in energy efficiency have been well documented by this point and as of the summer of 2014, I've yet to have any of my 7-8 LED bulbs go out on me which isn't surprising since they are supposed to last for years.<br /><br />So what I'm looking for in good LED bulb at this point is the function of the dimmer capabilities and the warmth (aka temperature) of the bulb.  My biggest issue with LED's is that they can still be a bit harsh inside, even the warm white (2700K) bulbs.<br /><br />As far the dimmer capabilities go, this bulb is top notch...it dims quickly and is sensitive enough to work fairly well with my dimmer.  You do have to turn it on at least medium to activate the light but then it will go lower and dimmer than most of my other LED bulbs.  Regarding temperature, I've found that all 2700K bulbs are not created equal.  This one is warmer and softer than other 27K LED's that I have, but they haven't gotten it as warm as I would like in an ideal situation.  Overall, I still like using LED for the energy savings and I would recommend the Bulbrite bulb if you are looking for an LED."

I was very exited to install this grill so I went into my garage and........talk about a letdown. It is NOT an exact fit even though the product page on Amazon says it will fit my car. The problem is that the longest horizontal bar (they are not all the same length) is about 1/8 inch wider than the hood scoop on each side. Fortunately, I have a bench grinder and after a few minutes worth of grinding, it now fits inside the hood scoop as it should have to begin with. I gave it 4 stars because I am very happy with the look but not with the fact that it required modification.<br />P.S. My hood scoop is factory so I am puzzled as to the poor fitment.  The areas that are ground are hidden inside the scoop so they cannot be seen but care should be taken so as not to damage the polished surfaces. All in all, the look is great"

Soymilk yogurt does not thicken naturally the way that dairy milk yogurt does, so I have been searching for ways to make the yogurt less runny.  I wanted to find something that creates a pleasant consistency AND something that does not require extra work (such as stirring anything over a hot stove).  Agar agar powder, xanthan gum, and tapioca starch have all been experimented with numerous times with varying results.  None have produced a satisfactory consistency.<br /><br />I'm glad to report that my first experiment with Ultra Gel was a success and I plan to continue using this from now on.  I added 1/2 cup Ultra Gel along with 2 Tbsp sugar to 6 cups of my homemade (unsweetened) organic soymilk. I also added a packet of vegan starter (purchased from Cultures for Health) and incubated this at 110 degrees for 8 hours (then chilled it for 12 more hours in the Cuisinart Electronic Yogurt Maker with automatic cooling).  The yogurt was perfect, exactly what I was hoping for.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
13289,5,Y,Kitchen,B003MU9F74,Wusthof Gourmet 12-Piece Knife Set with Block,Excellent Knife set,"I looked at a LOT of different knife reviews for the best block set in an good price range. After looking at a lot of products offered and the reviews on Amazon as well as other sites, I settled on this set.  Personally, I am very happy with my choice. The knives are very sharp and they do their job well.  The knives are very light in weight but I personally don't feel that has an effect on their performance.  I think if you want anything fancier you would have to spend hundreds of dollars for a professional set, which of course not everyone wants to do.  I am someone who cooks in the kitchen 6 days a week and I have not been disappointed by any of these knives. They meet my needs perfectly fine.  I should note that the block set comes with a couple of extra slots so I purchased the Wusthof Gourment Santoku and vegetable knifes so that the block would be full.  The Santoku knife does not come with this set but it is my favorite knife because it serves many cutting purposes.  Overall I would say I recommend this to anyone looking for good quality knife set but not wanting to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars."

Its heat retention allows you to create a golden crust on chicken like you've only dreamed of until now.  How do they get those black grill marks on vegetables without using a grill? Cast iron.  A 12&#34; pan is large enough to cook two chicken breasts at once, or two small steaks.  The pan is very heavy and does require special cleaning (brush out residue, wipe clean and apply oil) .  I have used this for over a year and the original seasoning is still in good shape."

This thing is very sturdy (and heavy) and the keyboard has a good feel to it.  Much better than my old HP keyboard.  The screen is sharp and I have not noticed any defects or artifacts.  Given it's weight this is definitely not something to travel with.  The first thing I did was swap the OS disk for a solid-state drive.  I retained the original disk for backups.  The addition of the second drive and the movement of the OS to the solid state driver was simple given the migration tools available on the ASUS website.

It's solid furniture that I feel good about having guests sit on it.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Sturdy/good quality<br />- Good color combination<br />- Easy to assemble<br /><br />CONS<br />- Cushions a little lumpy<br /><br />- Review done within thirty days so don't units haven't been weathered<br /><br />Shipping:  It's shipped through a local trucking firm.

Well that is until I used these Dropps.  The scent is exceptional and best of all goes right inside the drum of my HE washer. My clothes smell great which is on par with Snuggle but doesn't have that clogging effect on my clothes that I feel Snuggle does.  Love it and would highly recommend.

I somehow raised two children without anything happening, but with our youngest now learning how to pull himself up, I was terrified something might happen. I wasn't quite sure what we could do other than maybe wrap everything in bubble wrap and get rid of anything over 3 feet tall. Fortunately Dreambaby¬Æ was a step ahead of me. The products were easy to install and have given me peace of mind. As I watch my son creep and crawl around the room, I know when he pulls himself up he will be safe.

I'm also still able to see the shooting information in the view finder. This is worth the expense. I have not tried it with my macro lens yet but with the 24-70mm and the 70-200mm is a wonderful addition to my gear. As most of the reviewers pointed out it helps with framing the subject.<br /><br />The eye piece comes out of the frame of the camera a bit more 1/8&#34; than the stock eyepiece. I found this extremely comfortable and more fitting to my overall comfort holding the camera during focusing and framing. Well worth its price!

The same HDTV will see 47 channels in the living room including all free HD stations (which is really what I want) but only 30-33 stations in the bedroom.  I had high hopes for this unit, but it only improved the signal enough for the TV to recognize 36 (3-6 more) channels in the bedroom.  Unfortunately I'm still not getting the stations I really want.  Even still, I might keep and use the unit because I think it would boost the signal enough to help with some of the flakier stations in the living room, but it runs really hot and doesn't work at all when it's not plugged in (so I can't unplug it when I leave the house without disabling my webcam).  So I'm very disappointed and will look for other solutions.  It's possible I got a defective unit."

Yes, it's a fun toy. Oh, by the way, I'm 48 years old which says more about me than it does this product :-)<br /><br />P.S. It was unable to unlock any doors in my house. Should I return it?"
13343,4,N,Sports,B0047YS37W,SKLZ QuickSwing PX4 Baseball Trainer,"Works, but takes a bit of adjustment","This trainer helps drill ball players mainly in hand/eye coordination. It does not replicate pitching like a pitching machine but it does a fair job of reproducing soft toss with several variations built in. Overall this is bigger than it looks in the picture. The tubes have a disconcerting way of coming loose now and then, and the height adjustment knob should not be made of this kind of flimsy plastic, but otherwise it works as advertised. The dispensing of the ball onto the rebound net offers some element of unpredictability as the ball does not always bounce up to the same extent and direction. I suppose that is good. It is hard to draw a correlation from a scientific viewpoint but my kid has been using this for two weeks and the last few games have been a bit more productive for him after being on the machine. He has hit some pretty good line drives lately. I would like to think it is extra practice afforded by this machine, but the verdict is still out. All in all, a usable product."

13365,1,Y,Baby,B003ZUXWMU,"Dream On Me Deluxe Circular Playard with Jungle Gym, Yellow/Red",TOXIC PLASTIC FILTHY NIGHTMARE!,"I can't imagine putting anything you love near this thing let alone your little one! We received quickly (thanks, Amazon) but the good ended at opening the box and the plastic wrap this was in. It was clearly cheap molded plastic with sharp seam edges (think 1970s toxic junk you do NOT want your kid's mouth on that back then no one knew was toxic -- now with extra BPA!) and even worse, everything and I mean EVERYTHING in the sealed plastic wrap was covered in this gross, smoky, smelly, black soot. I mean really smelly. Like it sat behind the smokestack and next to the cigarette smokers on the trip overseas. Now I know this was made in China and of course I intended to wash it before putting it together BUT this was SO flithy I ended up putting each piece in the shower and the water ran black!<br /><br />But it was still covered in sooty grossness. First I tried green cleaners (the husband was telling me how we need this as our LO is just about to walk and she's in that I-need-to-cling-to-mommy-at-all-moments phase, which is cute, but hard to cook dinner or do laundry, so would I just PLEASE try to clean it and PLEASE give it a try???) and they didn't touch this stuff. Then I moved on to oxyclean and now I was GOING to clean this thing. Nope. Still factory employee fingerprinted black filth all over and by now there was that noxious bad plastic smell from the medium-warm shower water (I didn't want it to melt, just be clean). Finally I used bleach and had to seriously SCRUB each panel. The stickers for the decorations had all peeled off in transit (stick stickers to black dirt and they do not stick) so I didn't have to worry about them until later (Glue on?).<br /><br />But really, I wanted to return it from the get-go because it was gross and cleaning took FOREVER (DD was napping) but DH was home from work, saw the last panel, and he agreed it was filthy. But I almost finally finished cleaning it. I was at the point of thinking well after all that, I *could* cover the bars and top with our cloth crib rails and guardcover....and that might be okay for short periods of time and then DD hopefully wouldn't ingest something toxic or really be in contact with the plastic monstrosity....<br /><br />But then I tried to put this sucker together. Now I'm the one who usually does the putting together from all our computers and electronics to home repairs to assembling furniture from ikea (the bed is a beast, don't do it!), so plastic and screws no problem, right? By the time I got to the third panel, I discovered the bolts for many of the screws after all that cleaning were not made right and they would not fit without my doing metal work and readjusting the threads. So back this toxic nightmare went!<br /><br />We do like the big Graco bugs pack n play, but we were looking for something for the other end of the house and ""new"" so DD would find it more interesting than what she has and I didn't want to unload the toys from the family room, move the graco, and reload every single time the dryer is done or it's mealtime. Ugh! Big mistake. Waste of time and efforts, please don't let it be yours. AVOID THIS!<br /><br />(OH! But the one thing we did laugh about is this company did not even care enough to really translate the Chinese instructions into English so you get to have all kinds of fun trying to figure out the instructions like Seadog? Yeah, there's a dog and then there's a seal. Guessing it's the seal. It would be pretty easy to put together IF the screws worked though I never did get far enough to figure out the dog door.)"

I'm thrilled with the actual product, except getting the blades on/off properly to clean them is a complete pain in the ass. We tried everything until we realized that Bosch sells a special wrench (Amazon won't let me link to it -- just google ""bosch blender wrench"").<br /><br />Get the wrench. Your life will be so much easier. No more leaky blender, no more over tightened blades (to prevent leaking) that you can't get off without worrying about breaking it.

I went ahead and ordered it, but was prepared for splinters by having bought some duct tape (as suggested by reviewers) to cover the pole with. However, tape was not necessary because the pole looks and feels like smooth, flexible plastic. This is the ""original"" toy and pole, so perhaps only the later models are made of fiberglass??<br /><br />This Da Bird Super Pack is a good deal, with 5 toys altogether (1 on the pole + 3 refills + the peacock feather which is so long by itself that it doesn't have (or need) anything to fasten it to the pole because it can be used on its own. For the price, including shipping, this was the best deal I've seen.<br /><br />My cat was a stray, and hasn't been with me for long, and it is a major adjustment for her to be indoors all the time after having roamed freely for an unknown period of time. I really want her to have fun, mental stimulation, and exercise, so I was thrilled to see her play with Da Bird yesterday. What's nice about this is that she can catch it often which keeps her interested - unlike the Loco Laser which is just a tease that she can never catch and therefore has lost interest in. She only plays with her Midnight Crazies balls and her catnip mice for very brief spells. With Da Bird she has all the behaviors & excitement of chasing real prey, and plenty of exercise. Since the toy mimics live prey, I suspect she will remain interested in it. Will post if she doesn't.<br /><br />Reviewers are also correct in that the attachments come apart easily. The largest feather already fell off yesterday. I'm saving it to use with other feathers that will eventually fall off, and will make a new toy out of them.<br /><br />With this set having newly arrived, I haven't yet tried the other attachments or the peacock feather, and am trying to ""stretch"" them by using one at a time until each one is worn out...<br /><br />For the enjoyment and exercise this has given my cat, and the price of the Super Pack, I'm giving it 5 stars even though the feather has already fallen off."

This was a really nice upgrade from my old Samsung one, which I had to replace because the disc drive failed after 3 or so years of use. Hopefully this Sony unit will hold out better since Sony claims they have sealed the disc drive from dust and contaminates, which the Samsung was atrocious. This player has Wi-Fi built in it, as well as your Ethernet port. The Wi-Fi works great, and seems to perform better than my old Samsung player. Every app you can conceive of for entertainment delivery is available. You just simply setup your Sony account on your computer. From there, you can enable or add apps to your Blu-ray player. Since this a is a new model, Sony updates it regularly. The update process is painless and easy to do. Blu-ray play is great on it so far, and the sound comes out great in my Yamaha theater system.

I've tried several different brands and while I can't say I notice a great deal of difference in the performance of the powders--how they mix into the smoothie, how I feel after using them for a while, etc.--there IS an obvious difference in the taste. For example, while I hate to blast my beloved Trader Joe's, the taste of their brand of vanilla protein powder is astonishingly poor. If you take a taste of the Muscle Milk brand and then immediately try a bit of the Trader Joe's, it is not much of an exaggeration to say that the latter has a taste and consistency that is barely one step above sawdust (please, dear reader, note that I do not actually eat sawdust, but I am guilty of a bit of artistic license in my reviews). Other brands, while not quite THAT bad, are still way behind Muscle Milk in the taste category. This is the only brand I have found which really tastes good--like something you'd want to drink in a shake even if you DIDN'T need protein powder.<br /><br />So having tried 6 or 7 brands now, I can easily say that this is not only the best tasting, but the best tasting BY FAR. Highly recommended."

13458,1,Y,Musical Instruments,B0058MJX4O,Sony ECMCS3 Clip style Omnidirectional Stereo Microphone,"requires plug-in power, might not work on your device!","I bought two of these to go with my newly purchased (and not cheap either) Tascam recorder.  These mics require ""plug-in power"" (different from Phantom power) which you might imagine every device provides these days.  Not so.  From what I've read (however too late), electret mics have very specific power needs in order to function.<br /><br />I tried looking for a reasonable power supply fix.  None existed, unless I were to buy a proper preamp or something.  At that point, you might as well spend the money on proper mics that don't need the extra gear.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  You must thoroughly double-check your equipment to make sure it provides ""plug-in power.""  Or else, like me, you'll find these don't work at all!  No signal, nothing!!!  Terrible waste."

I used the lure in the jar, and the cute little plastic apple. I kept needing to  begin anew with every emerging generation,  The Fly Web Trap has finally stemmed the tide. I purchased a second trap near an island bar sink, which I plan to try in the RV, briefly when we are going in and out when it is getting dark. It should eliminate the moth or three that wanted to ping-pong from my Kindle and my glasses when I turn in for the night. I say briefly because it is quite bright.<br />I have also used  InVade Bio Cleaner Drain Gel, for the drain flies at first and plan to keep it on hand, just in case!"

Burner was turned off but still warm. Both the bottom of the carafe and the stove are black, but I noticed smoking then when I moved the carafe, the bottom was completely burned out in less than five minutes. Manufacturer COULD cheaply fix this potentially dangerous problem by putting stainless steel on the bottom or putting copper on the bottom. It appears to be stainless all the way around but the bottom is not at all heat resistant. The mess did clean up without harm, I used a spatula to lift the burnt plastic off the stove.<br /><br />I used it for about one year. The top fits exactly one four cup melita filter."

Long battery life. When I need a screwdriver, I don't always have time to charge it. This battery remains charged for quite a few months, so it's ready when you need it.<br /><br />2. I love the size. It seems to me that more often than not, I don't have room to use my full sized power driver. This one is just right. It's big enough to tackle tough screws, but small enough to fit into small places.<br /><br />3. The retractible magnetic screw holder is so handy, you'll wonder why anyone would want a driver without it. Sometimes there isn't enough room for you to hold the screw in place, or you need to use your other hand to hold something else. As long as the screw is magnetic, you just pill out the screw holder and it stays in place. Once the screw starts moving in, the holder slides back into place."

I used the clips - I ran it off a loose deep cycle marine battery, then charge the battery during the day as I drove from trail to trail via some jumper cables and the lucky extra, unused, 2nd battery tray in my van.  It was cheap, so I consider it disposable.  If it lasts a year I'll be thrilled and will happily purchase another.

Speakers are a nice size not to big not to small I thought the towers would  be to big for my room but everything worked out great are room measures 16x12.

Some sexual content.<br />Stand alone read.  7th in The Texas Firefighters series.<br /><br />GOOD READ!  Well written, unusual storyline, exceptional characters, honest and heartfelt dialogue, diverse supporting cast, strong family theme, angst-filled romance, and the author writes very sensitively about the loss of a loved one and the shattered emotional state of those left behind.  HOWEVER, this book is difficult book to read in places, the honesty of the emotions that play out in the book, touch the reader to the point of sadness.<br /><br />THIS STORY follows dedicated ER doctor, Rachel Culver, and firefighter, Cale Jackson, in the aftermath of the tragic death of Noelle Culver, Rachel's twin sister and Cale's fianc√©e.  During the intervening eighteen months since Noelle's death, Cale has struggled to deal with his loss, but Rachel has simply filled her life with work and study to avoid grieving and feeling guilty about the fight she had with her sister the night she died.  Everyone recognizes the Rachel must face the pain and emptiness of losing her twin, but it is Cale who tries to reach her and share the reality of their loss, in hopes that both of them can move on (cvpl).<br /><br />OVERALL, a engaging storyline, but it is the heartfelt emotions that make this a good read.  This is not a easy, quick fix plot, grieve today - gone tomorrow, but a touching story of facing a deeply felt loss and surviving that loss to love again.  THE TEXAS FIREFIGHTERS series includes Playing With Fire, A Little Consequence, Fully Involved, Burning Ambition, Island Haven, After the Storm, and A Time for Us.<br /><br />You may enjoy the complex characters and storytelling of N. Bruhns, A. Stuart, and E. Palfrey. For sweet, funny, heart touching romances with great descriptive imagery, try Susan Fox and Cara Colter."

Season passes that work, poor execution on series 3.","I bought my first TiVo DVR when the series 1 30 hour dropped from $700 to $400 and put lifetime service on it one year later.  I loved it and upgraded it's storage.  I hacked it to play with it since I worked with Linux professionally.  I even got it setup with a USB ethernet adapter and had it calling on my broadband.  I never thought I would get a competitors DVR.<br /><br />Later I switched to DirecTV with the integrated series 2 TiVo (RCA DVR40 I believe, 3 of them).  The single DVR payment for as many devices at my house was a big factor.  I modified these to enable multi room viewing, etc.  The limitations of features out of the box began to turn me off.  I had to go through way too much trouble to get things working right, but I did.<br /><br />Later I upgrade to HD and didn't want to use the DirecTV HD DVR.  I got a series 3 unit (they were brand new, my wife thought I was nuts) and transferred the lifetime service using the limited time $200 offer spending just over $1000.  I switched to cable, but the cable cards were expensive and I needed 2.  SDV was deployed a month or 2 later.  The tuning adapters took forever to become available and I never was able to get one.<br /><br />I eventually switched to DirecTV HR23 recievers and the TiVo took a secondary spot in my home.  The DirecTV DVR definately seemed inspired by the TiVo and seemed to do everything I wanted.  I eventually got their whole home DVR option and that prevented me from getting new DirecTV TiVO dvrs.<br /><br />My series 3 DVR spent years powered on but never watched.  When I moved into Suddenlink territory I considered it but the TIVo cost too much compared to what I had with DirecTV and the HR23 (and now HR24).  I would also need two cable cards for my series 3 since it never worked with m-cards despite the original marketing driving costs even higher.<br /><br />I finally decided to got OTA only, so I dusted off the series 3.  I'm interested in the Roamio OTA, but I'm not sure I want to send any more money your way right now.  I'll probably by a used series 3 lifetime unit to provide a multi room option that will always work."

13648,4,Y,Electronics,B008NQVA2A,JOB 225 2-channel Power Amplifier,"An incredible bargain, once initial problems were solved","The JOB 225 is a high-bandwidth, Swiss-made stereo amplifier. It's priced to compete with similarly priced NAD, Rotel, and Parasound offerings, but frankly, it's in a different galaxy from those products.<br /><br />Before expressing more praise for this amplifier, however, I have to provide an account of my experience with it. I was an early purchaser of the JOB 225, and like a number of other early purchasers of this amplifier, I had a problem with 60 Hz hum emanating from the loudspeakers. When I contacted JOB Electronics (apparently a marque of the ultra-high-end brand Goldmund), the company at first seemed skeptical that there was a problem with the amplifier.<br /><br />Once JOB/Goldmund acknowledged the problem, however, the response was swift. JOB paid for return shipping to Switzerland and had my amplifier back in my possession within two business days. The problem with 60 Hz hum was gone. Reportedly, other users with humming JOB 225s will be able to ship their amplifiers to a service center in NYC for repair/modification.<br /><br />The repaired/modified JOB 225 sounds spectacularly transparent. Adding this amp to my system has expanded soundstage width and depth, and increased image specificity.<br /><br />Before purchasing this amp, keep in mind both that output power is limited and that the amp generates a lot of heat. Use with electrostatic or other difficult-to-drive speakers should be ruled out. Use with truly high-end speakers nevertheless appears possible. One user has reported extraordinary results with TAD CR-1s.<br /><br />In all, I'm pleased with my purchase. I would have rated it five stars if not for the initial 60 Hz hum problem.<br /><br />NOTE ON SHIPPING: Though Amazon reports an estimated delivery time several weeks away, I and all other JOB 225 users with whom I've communicated received our amps in a couple of business days via FedEx International Priority. Yes, you get shipping at Amazon Prime speed from Geneva for $70."

The single pole handle is a little unsteady over curbs, but since every double pole handle I have is either jammed or broken altogether, I am happy with it."

13658,5,Y,Apparel,B002YKSZT2,8444 Ultra Force Black M-65 Field Jacket (Medium),buying another one!,these jackets are great! I got a medium because I normally wear a large. do what the other reviews say and you wont have any issues with the sizing. they also do their job well when it comes to keeping you warm. this winter got to good ol' Wisconsin lows and it still managed to keep me warm. I ripped my last m65. I wouldn't blame the jackets durability for the rip since I treated the field jacket like crap for the past year.

Yes it would sound better through a surround sound system, but for stock sound it isn't bad. The Smart TV set up was easy and my wife is all over the Netflix!

13678,4,N,Video Games,B006WQR3V0,XCOM: Enemy Unknown - Playstation 3,Great Turn Based Game,"What a great game.  I never played the original so I'm coming to this version fresh.  The thing I love about it is that it is something different for the Playstation 3.  The options and different difficulty levels on this game open it up for a lot of replay.  I played through about four times when I originally got the game a year ago.  I've taken time off from it to play some other games and have come back to it having forgotten the strategies I used so it's been fun relearning them.    The graphics are pretty good, I really can't speak to the graphics quality but I enjoy the special effects (the explosions, gun fire, ect).  The art style is appealing but not hyper realistic.      The game has great customization for the soldiers.  Some people care about that type of thing while others don't.  I personally enjoy working to advance my troops up through the ranks and trying to give each his or her own personal appearance.  There is a wide variety of skills to assign but as I remember some are decidedly better than others strategy wise.    If fun and hard turn based games are something you might be interested in I couldn't recommend any game more highly than this one."

Optically it's about as good as it gets.  Distortion is very well controlled.  Build quality is excellent, as expected.  The clutch focusing mechanism works very well, and auto focus performance is quick and more accurate than some of the other X lenses.  The f/2.8 aperture, combined with the great high ISO ability of the X system, makes this a great wide angle lens for reportage style shooting.  Use it indoors without worry.  It's reasonably compact as well, something that can't be said for all of Fuji's lenses.  Much smaller than Fuji's wide angle zoom lens.  If you're looking for an ultra wide and are OK with 21mm equivalent, you can stop looking."

The night illumination is &#34;meh&#34; for a few feet. I installed this CMVision IR130 last night -- wow, what a difference. I now have running snapshots of the little night critters running around in the back yard; the picture is clear for a good 30 yards, a little less so after that. (I fault the camera -- it IS a cheap-and-cheery solution, so I'm pleased with the results overall.)<br /><br />There's a panther slinking around the area (I have read where they can range this far north). I finally got a snap of the beast and showed it to my neighbor who hunts in the area. Proof that the yowls we've been hearing belong to a walking creature.

The fact that it remembers your last setting was a must for me as I didn't want it to come on bright in the middle of the night. Of all the lights I have, I find Olight to have the best interface. Clicking through multiple times at a fast rate to get to hidden settings just doesn't work as well as this. Normal operation is easy, the rotation of the head to change modes is smooth and feels solid, not cheap. Good clip, well machined flashlight. Converted me to an Olight user."

I also wanted a smaller ratchet for benifets of speed and the ability to use in tighter places.  Overall I'm happy with it. This ratchet was slightly cheaper than the Craftsman equivalent. It feels like decent quality and it has both 3/8&#34; and 1/4&#34; on either side of the head, which has come in surprisingly useful. The only complaint I have is the direction switch is a bit to easy to hit accidentally while in use on the one I received. That complaint aside, I still recommend it if your considering it."

Its not like bungy where it lifts off the racks once at speed,  this thing has a bungy in it but also a strap so you can pull it tight and it stays put, great product"

Well guess what happened? Hmm thats weird she lost her ring the second day she had it, not even 48 hours and gone. The other good part about this situation is that her yard is about 16 acres oh and there is about 2.5 feet of snow. So I am thinking she ran all over her yard that day playing with her dog and how are we ever going to find that thing before her dad snow blows a trail through the yard or mows the lawn in spring/summer. I got it, its made of metal, I have always wanted a metal detector before, why not? So I am looking on amazon and I don't want to pay out the butt for one and I come across this beast. I saw all of the great reviews and the ridiculously low price-Perfect. I make the order ASAP, wait for it and two days before I get it, Guess what, her dad snow blows. Great... Well when I get it I take it for a spin and test it out, brilliant discrimination features, good sensitivity, and good depth. Awesome, but will I be lucky to find it in one piece? I bring it over there the next day and start searching, I adjust all the features to what I think is good and get to it. She gives me a general Idea of where she thinks she may have lost it about a 50 yard perimeter, I had decided to search a little more outside of It just in case. About 15 min later I am right on the trail her dad made with the snow blower, BEEP. You got to be kidding me, we dig up a chunk of snow about 8in deep set it aside and I check it, BEEP. Wow, I thought could it really be that easy? We break the chunk apart and there it is, YEA! It was right next to the tire track of where the snow blower past through. We were so happy, we found what was special plus the fact that the metal detector already paid for itself as well. It sure did its job and I would highly recommend thisproduct to anyone. I am also looking forward to using it for the hobby later and if something like this happens again, I will know exactly what to do."

I used this one in the car seat and the other any time he was in a bouncer, swing, etc. the only time he laid flat was at night. I unlike other reviewers did not use it at night as I was not comfortable with that. I can't say if this is the only reason his head is now almost fully round ( no one would notice the slight flat spot) or if it's just part of the reason but what I do know is if I have another baby we will use these from day one.

13910,3,N,Books,006103116X,The Rock Says...,Dwayne Johnson - The Rock Says,"The Rock Says...: The Most Electrifying Man in Sports-Entertainment.<br /><br />By Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson with Joe Layden.<br /><br />Published by HarperEntertainment.<br /><br />Released January 5, 2000.<br /><br />Pages 304, hard back.<br /><br />No introduction is necessary for Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, he is possibly the most recognised wrestler of all time, a successful movie star, one of the top merchandise sellers of all time inside the wrestling industry and one of the most charismatic superstars ever. Gaining world heavyweight championship gold a total of 9 times in a relatively short full time career of 8 years. The Rock is unquestionably a future inductee into the WWE Hall of Fame.<br /><br />But does The Rock Says... have the same credentials as the man telling his story? As you would expect there is a lot of humour through-out the retelling of The Rock's story. The first six chapters of the book cover his early life, football career and training for his future in Sports-Entertainment complete with amusing anecdotes mirrored by the mischief he got himself caught up in as a teenager. The following nine chapters are devoted to his in ring career, recounting his metamorphosis from Rocky Maivia into The Rock, taking you to the time so you can understand why the audience were the deciding factor in Dwayne going from a sparkling clean good guy to the third person speaking, cocky villain known as the 'People's Champion'. Rock recalls backstage shenanigans as he tells his story, most notably with Mick Foley, Rocky also covers key matches and points in his career telling the matches as if he is in the match, speaking in character, in third person. The Rock Says... follows the Most Electrifying Man in Sports-Entertainment all the way up until Wrestlemania 15 against his arch nemesis 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin. There is an additional emotional chapter added before it was published dedicated to remembering the life of Owen Hart who tragically died during the period of time the book was written in.<br /><br />The main flaw with this autobiography of The Rock is it was written too soon, at publication in 2000 it was at the height of his career, being only half way through his full time portion. Even though he tells the matches as if they were legitimate rather than as they actually are, he does discuss certain behind the scenes aspects, however do not expect a tell all, expose the business type read. Overall The Rock Says... is an entertaining read if you are a fan of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and want to know about his life before wrestling mixed with funny stories from his career up until Wrestlemania 15.<br /><br />3/5 Stars<br /><br />By Jimmy Wheeler"

13924,5,N,Office Products,B006M1MFEA,HP OfficeJet Pro 8100 Wireless Photo Printer with Mobile Printing (CM752A),Excellent Printer  !! FAST !!,"The 8100 Pro is just a printer.  That's all it does. But, it does it so well!  As a teacher, my wife does a lot of high volume printing.  Print speed and ink cartridge life are paramount. This printer delivers. While your average inkjet printer will deliver 7 pages per minute, this one shoots pages out at 20+ per minute.  Even at high resolution settings, it's still 3X as fast as any other injet we have. Two sided printing is slower as it takes a small break after printing the first side to allow the ink to dry before running the page through for side 2.<br /><br />Print cartridges reportedly hold about 10ml color and 20ml black.  They last a very long time. They can also be refilled if you choose to do so. If you do use recycled or refilled cartridges, just push ""OK"" when the printer points out you're not using a genuine or refilled HP cartridge. I've found unplugging newer HP printers, while removing and refilling cartridges, eliminates those warnings all together. Probably depends what firmware is on board.<br /><br />Setup was easy and only took a few minutes to get the printer on our wireless network and available to all 5 computers in the house. No problems encountered with Vista 32 or 64 bit or Windows 7 OS. No problems printing pictures from Windows Photo Gallery. It's a good, fast printer."

Note the refresher can be applied on a yearly basis without stipping the floor first.  If you use the polish, it should be stripped before it is reapplied.

13993,2,N,Furniture,B0057PS7RG,"Coaster Home Furnishings 600229 Recliners Casual Leatherette Swivel Recliner, Black",Swivel Recliner,"i bought this chair last year. after one month it collapsed down while i was sitting in it.  when i assembled the chair i didn't think it had a very strong base and the chair just sat on the pedestal post (not bolted together) so if you lifted the chair by the seat assembly it comes apart.  you have to pick it up by the base.  after it collapsed, i took the base unit apart, i realized what a poor design it was.  the center post is held up by a single bolt crudely welded to the bottom of the post pointing downward. this supported the weight of the entire chair!  the welds had broken and the post collapsed around the bolt.  return shipping was out of the question (more than the chair cost), so it sat in the garage until today.  i took a cylindrical 1 1/2"" metal spacer and dropped into the base tube, put the original post tube through the plastic spacer and dropped that into the base.  you must use the original post since it tapers at the top to fit into the seat assembly.  now it projected from the base long enough to sit the chair back on.  it's working better than new! it feels sturdier and it pivots smoother too.<br /><br />when i took the original base apart there were some cheap, thin roller bearings in the bottom of the tube that served no purpose.  the chair doesn't pivot on the bearings, the seat pivots on the top of the post (i checked), the post itself doesn't turn. the vertical bolt welded inside the post tube and holding the chair up is an idiotic design.  when the bolt weld breaks away, the post just drops down into the base leaving the seat assembly flopping around and unusable.<br />after original assembly, i deployed the foot-rest once (a hassle) then used an ottoman instead (much better).<br /><br />since the chair has only been used for a month, i can't say anything about the durability of the upholstery or reclining/footrest. i don't recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />NOTE: this same chair is sold by a number of vendors. check out ""Coaster Fine Furniture Casual Leatherette Swivel Recliner in Black Leatherette"" at Amazon for an example."

So I agree with the dimensions another reviewer posted.<br /><br />I tried to get on three different airlines with this bag and it was rejected twice and I got charged more in an EXTRA bag fee ($80) than the actual cost of this bag on my International flight in Asia!  Only Southwest Airlines permitted it.

14032,4,Y,Home Improvement,B0045LSFBG,"Sprite White Bath Ball Filter (White, 1)",Works pretty well!,I was a bit skeptical prior to purchasing this filter due to the mixed reviews but so far I've been really pleased with this bath ball filter!  The Velcro straps have held strong and the product was very easy to install. My bath spout is very similar to the one pictured but I imagine it would not work on anything much different than that due to it's design and the plastic support arm that goes underneath.  I am not able to adjust the water pressure when filling the tub (it's just one single handle) so some of the water doesn't get filtered but I'd say at least 90% does which is a lot better than nothing in my opinion.<br /><br />Our water doesn't have an odor so I can't say whether it helps with that or not but I did notice that my skin felt significantly less dry than normal after two baths so I'm confident it's working.

They fit snugly and the ear part is very comfortably padded. They're adjustable and lock in place on the adjustment you choose. They fold up very compactly and fit in the nifty little drawstring bag that's included. They are very well made & sturdy. She's always on her Zoodles &#34;Kid Mode&#34; app on either my or my husband's phone or tablet . It's a great, educational app with songs, video storybooks, etc. It keeps her quiet & engaged but in doctors offices, the car, church, the market or even while we're watching tv at home.....we have to listen to her shuffle through the app content. Not any more! These have worked wonders. The only flaw to me is the cord. I like that it's only on one side but it still gets in the way a little. They'd be 100% flawless if they were cordless.

So make sure when you place your order that you are getting the Ginsana energy and not the Ginsana Bodygold Energy. I have asked them to change the picture on Amazon, so you will know what you are actually getting.  I would not have ordered the product, if the picture was listed as Bodygold.  There is nothing in the description that says what the ingredients are.<br />I returned the product.  I would expect that when I place an order that I would get what I actually ordered.<br />I have taken the Ginsana Energy since 1997, so I knew exactly what it should have looked like.

14094,1,N,Apparel,B0002TOZ28,"Gold Toe Men's Cotton Quarter Athletic Sock, Black, 6-Pack Size 10-13",Gold Toe - a once great company that sold out.,"There was a time, not too long ago, when Gold Toe made the best socks that money could buy. They were twice or even three times as expensive as the competition, but considering that a pair could be washed and used thirty times or more before wearing out, they were still the best deal in town. Buying 12 pairs at a time, all looking the same of course, would set me for a year.<br /><br />Then a few years ago I noticed something had happened. Gold Toe had become strangely affordable, only somewhat more expensive than the generic brands. The next thing I noticed was after a couple of washes, some of them had shrunk, others had holes in them, and within short just about all of them had worn out. Being a long time Gold Toe fan, i hoped it was just a bad batch, so gave them one more chance. Same thing. I am guessing Gold Toe has, like so many other companies, fired their workers and are simply slapping their label on production runs from the same sweat shops that make the regular generic wear and dispose clothing.<br /><br />I no longer buy Gold Toe as I see little reason to pay extra without getting anything extra. If someone could recommend a quality sock maker still in business I am all ears."

I used it to inflate some large river run tubes from my car and was very please with the speed an ease of inflating the tubes. It is aimed for high volume, not high pressure, so for some inflatables you might want to top off with a higher pressure hand pump, but It gave enough pressure for the tube to be comfortable for floating down a river. It was quieter than I expected. I do wish there was a way to secure the attachments to the pump so I don't have worry about losing them. I am keeping the box to keep it all together."

I could have sworn when I placed these on my wish list a while back that it stated the set included lunch plates. When I received the set this Christmas, I opened the box to find bread & butter sized plates, as the outside of the box does state. These are not large enough for a sandwich, but could pass as a small dessert plate. I came back to amazon.com to see what the description states, and it does now state b&b plates, so maybe I was just imagining it? But I think that it originally did list lunch plates and that it was recently edited. It's the lunch plates that I needed the most. :-("

I have a very picky senior cat who won't eat anything other than dry kibble (no wet food whatsoever) so I was a bit worried about this liquid making his food soggy, making him not eat it. Due to the fact that he has horrible skin and sheds in chunks of fur, this would have been highly disappointing.  However I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that this product doesn't make the food soggy at all and once it has dried, my cat cannot tell the difference. My 8 week old kitten is also very fond of the taste.

The tv could not keep up with all the little legs going every where and you could see some scaling for a second and you would say what was that. This was very noticeable to me because my old TV did not do this. This happened intermittingly through out the game but not all the time.  This is not a true 240hz refresh rate but Vizio's make believe version of it. Still debating on sending it back... Everything else is great and normal TV looks awesome. Update.... Ended up keeping do to it was so close to super bowl and I needed for a party.

I was most disappointed.<br /><br />I own all 5 sets of Doc Martin which I enjoy very much (I have viewed all 5 series several time and have learned to like the characters and, of course, the scenery. Doc Martin's personality is too much at times. Is he so full of hate that he seems incapable to show some tenderness towards his lovely wife?"

14214,5,Y,Outdoors,B001OI2LZY,"Continental Gatorskin Bicycle Tire (700x25, Wire Beaded, Black)",Hardy like a gator!,"I had a rocky start with the Gatorskin, catching 3 rear flats in the first 3 weeks after putting these on (they were all legit flats; 2 goathead thorns and 1 bit of wire probably blown out of car radial tires) last October. Since then I've had only 2 flats in 7 months, though, and I ride through a lot of broken glass debris in the streets of San Diego, CA.<br /><br />The Gatorskin is thick and heavy, but then I ride aluminum roadie, so I don't mind a few extra ounces. New tire takes a bit of kneading to get on, but if you knead it right you don't need to use tire levers to help. The PSI info on the tire is pretty hard to read (it's obscured by the yellow thread on the sidewall), but mine list max PSI at 120. I'm pretty light (130 lbs), though, and usually run them between 85-90 PSI for softer riding and lower rolling resistance. Never had pinched flat on them and they run great.<br /><br />The rear Gatorskin developed 'square top' after about 1000 mile or so. 750 miles later it is still working well and has plenty of meat left (and I've been riding off road a bit with my road bike... They've gone up Nate Harrison Grade, Black Canyon Rd, and Mother Grundy Truck Trail without much problem (they do skid when you climb 14% grade ramps on loose gravel, but that's about it). I don't rip it down curvy mountain roads because I'm aware of the squared top rear tire and the tires handle just fine down things like Palomar South Grade Rd or Mesa Grande Rd or Honey Springs Rd.<br /><br />Bottom line: I got these tires for their hardiness and they are indeed very hardy. They were pretty sticky when new, but that wore off within a week or two. Now they grip fine on normal road condition and even when the road is a bit wet (I go safely slow when wet, though, so I don't know how they do if you want to race with them in wet weather)."

14221,1,N,Home Improvement,B005IVTITK,"Hunter 21433 Sonora 52-Inch 5-Blade Single Light Ceiling Fan, Antique Pewter with Black/Cherry Blades and White Linen Glass Light Bowl",This Hunter Fan's Not What They Advertitse in Terms of Quality,"I recently purchased a Hunter Fan(model 59531). After installing the fan and turning the power back on, the fan did not work. I flicked the switch to the on position and pulled the chain for the light and for the fan. Neither one operated the fan. I would have tried the remote, but the toggle switches appeared to be broken inside of it. The purchase occurred over 3 months ago as we purchased the fan in preparation for a new home to be completed. Unfortunately, because the builder delayed their construction timeline the normal return window expired before we opened the box to install it. Since I was unable to use the remote to try to turn on the fan, I continued to use the pull chains to operate the fan.<br /><br />Thinking that I possibly hooked up the wires incorrectly, I disassembled the fan and started over again. After completely rewiring all of the wires again, I went and tested the fan and again it did not work. At this point, being totally frustrated, I rewired the entire fan without the remote receiver and it ran fine, or so I thought.<br /><br />There were approximately 5 red screws that needed to be removed to allow the blades to self balance. After the red screws were removed there was still a HUGE wobble in the fan when it ran on any speed other than the lowest speed. Thus the self correcting - AUTO BALANCE feature did not work.<br /><br />When rating a fan I would think most consumers are looking for some of the same items I was and so I am rating the overall categories as follows:<br /><br />Cosmetic/Appearance- 4 stars<br />Ease of Installation- 1 star- Too many parts compared to competitor fans in similar price range<br />Reliability- 1 star - Remote and auto balance feature did not work<br />Cost- 1 star- Competitor Fans with similar features to the Hunter model cost less<br />Features/Benefits- 1 star- Features do not work<br />Overall Rating- 1 star- It looks good but just doesn't work.<br /><br />I am sure Hunter makes good fans, but this isn't one of them."

The build quality is very good and dust collection was pretty good. Perhaps a very small annoyance was the balance and lack of forward handle to keep it firmly against the edge of the piece being cut.

14255,4,Y,Camera,B003TYA7TI,Fancierstudio 1000watt Lighting Kit Black White Muslin Backdrop and background stand kit By Fancierstudio K105BW,"Great kit, bad bulbs, solid results","For the price, this kit is a real winner. That said though, the CFLs included in this kit are epic failures. I read some reviews about the bulbs failing or catching on fire, but assumed that would be unlikely. While I didn't have any ""fiery"" experiences, I encountered a close-second when the large 105wt CFL began smoking - yes, literally - and then flickered out moments later. At that time I was more than a bit concerned and went to check the other 105wt bulb and found that the base was incredibly hot (especially for a CFL) and that it too smelled like an electrical fire. I decided to opt for safety and take that bulb out as well. I should also add that the bulbs had only been on for about 30 minutes - which brought their grand lifespan to about 2.5 hours.<br /><br />OK, enough about junky bulbs from China. The rest of the kit: The stands aren't particularly heavy duty, but definitely up to the task for what I need them for - and I think as long as they're treated relative care, you (and I) will get lots of life out of them. I just used them for a video project and the lighting was great. I didn't need to use the backdrops, but found the other stands as a great help for various gear and other clamp lights I use.<br /><br />The backdrops themselves are a bit sheer, but still decent quality considering the overall price of the kit. If you look at them as a ""free bonus"" in the kit, you won't be disappointed - but they won't compare with the better, pricier muslin you can buy. The only concern you'd need to address is lighting behind the backdrops popping through. If you can keep that in check, they will work great.<br /><br />I know it sounds silly, but I was very impressed with the bag - it's a great size, and decent quality. Everything fits right back in the bag without hours of careful planning. Tear the gear down and then stick it in the bag. Zip. Tada! So many bags are the exact size of the equipment, so unless you have a degree in space planning or zippered-duffle-bag management, you're bound to spend a fair bit of time stuffing it all back in there. Not so with this bag - plenty of space for the kit, and I was even able to toss a bag of quick clamps in there and some additional bulbs... yeah, remember those bulbs I mentioned above? Glad I thought to bring backups.<br /><br />So the final verdict? It's a great deal. The bulbs may burn your house or studio down, but if you keep a fire extinguisher handy (or just don't use them at all), you'll be quite pleased to enjoy the nice, even lighting and decent backdrop kit."

The sizes I mostly fasten range from 13 to 17 millimeters.<br /><br />The material:<br />This adapter is made of an impact resistant steel, coated with a black smooth non-reflective material. The steel is of a great quality, because I've been using it for at least 6 months and it didn't shatter, didn't show markings, scratches and is really corrosion resistant.<br /><br />The design:<br />This adapter has a simple yet effective design. It fits perfectly to my impact driver and is really easy to attach to many different sockets. The adapter has a ball-and-spring locking mechanism which found itself really sturdy for many applications. The way I work, I have to keep on switching between sockets all day long and after 6 months of continuous use the mechanism still works as new.<br /><br />Overall:<br />It's worth a 5 star overall rating. It's tough, it's corrosion resistant, it's locking mechanism works fine, it's impact resistant and it's cheap for the quality you get. I totally recommend it."

Over email, I let them know that I was not interested in the Gen 2 model and did not wish to continue with the order. In the meantime, the product had already shipped, and the charge to my card was processed. Long story short, Wayfair was definitely WAY FAIR about it! They got the product back before it got to me and promptly refunded the money. This easily could have turned into a hassle with a significant chunk of change, but it didnt. I would definitely consider doing business with Wayfair again.<br />Now, on to the product review. I ended up getting the Armasight Nemesis6x-ID Gen 2+ Night Vision Rifle Scope w/6x Magnification, as advertised, from optics planet. This scope is phenomenal!!! I have a lower end Gen 1 monocular, and compared to that, the difference is literally night and day. I set up with it the other night, with about 25% of the moon lit up, and watched some coyotes about 400 yards away. I could nearly count their teeth!!! The only downside to this scope is that I can see farther than I feel confident shooting with the gun I have it mounted on.<br />Before the moon comes out, when its pitch black, it still provides a decent picture. With the IR spotlight that comes with it, you can see about 100 yards with no other light, as long as youre not getting a reflection from nearby objects.<br />All in all, the Armasight Nemesis6x-ID Gen 2+ Night Vision Rifle Scope w/6x Magnification is worth it."

He gave me a prescription cream to clear it up but told me I had to find something that worked for me because I couldn't stay on the prescription cream forever.  I did some research and people raved about this so I tried it.  Wow!  It works!  I've been using it for about 4 weeks now (with no more prescription cream) and my lips have yet to get chapped again.

14421,3,Y,Video Games,B00EFRN2IQ,The Sims 4 - PC/Mac,Advent Simmer,"I recently purchased this game through amazon, I didn't buy it at first because I didn't think it was worth anywhere near 70$ so... I waited for a price drop. I can honestly say after having played on and off for a little over a week, even with the price drop this game is certainly not worth anywhere past 40$. I could write a whole page review concerning this game but many of the things that I would say have been said by other reviewers. Also even with all the reviews I'd gone through and looking at the let's play videos, I still purchased this game; I have been a simmer since TS1 so with the price drop I decided to give this game a try. Not everything in TS4 is awful; their new build mode and the rich vibrant (even though the environmental background might be simulated) neighborhood is welcoming and fresh. I'm not too keen on the loading screens in fact I'm curious to see how that will pan out once expansion packs start its' release. The toddler stage has been completely omitted so the infant ""popping"" out to a full grown child is honestly ridiculous and hilarious. I also don't dislike or like the pre-color coded options. It works and it doesn't work, meaning some of the design/color options are just terrible and unable to match. I also began to see a growing number of bugs here and there I'm not certain if it was because I kept the game turned on for awhile or because the Sims game as we all know it has an increasing amount of bugs in the first place. I understand that alot of the things that were omitted were to have the game run smoother and it does but it has a design flaw. The game grows on you and it's fun however how long will that last for its' asking price or until the first expansion pack is released? All in all for those of you out there who are on the fence about buying this game like many others have said, buy it for the right price. This base pack certainly lacks content for its' asking price but that is also nothing new with the Sims game franchise,unfortunately. (i.e ts3 eps)    (edited: the gameplay itself is fun and it delivers in that aspect. I've noticed that I enjoy playing ts4 more so than I ever did with ts3)"

You can buy similar products at Home Depot, Walmart, and other stores for $39.99 that don't work any better than these do. According to some reviews, some of them may not work or may be defective on receipt and this is probably due to poor quality control by the manufacturer. However, Amazon.com stands by it's products and you can always return defective items for a full replacement or refund with no hassle.<br /><br />In any case, you can buy three of these for the price you would pay for one anywhere else. And, by the way, they are supposed to make a beeping noise, the louder the better! You should ignore the complaints of other reviewers about these units making too much noise! Shame on them because that is the whole purpose of  audio (sonar) mole and gopher repellers!<br /><br />As a final note, there is a big advantage to the design of these units because you can replace the battery and other components easily (as mentioned by another reviewer). With most other products of this type you just have to throw them away when they fail. With this product, you can replace the battery and other components easily,"

I do not play Metal so can't comment. AB&#34;d with some vintage Jenson Alnicos  and must say these speakers stood up to the test. Do not believe you can find a better guitar speaker for the money.. these are dirt cheap 70 -75 bucks for a pair.They are nice and shimmery on clean settings- have good mids and highs. A little weak on lower frequency but you can dial in to compensate. They break up nice. Not floppy  and not harsh sounding. Also compared them to Jenson ceramic C10. The C-10 had greater mid range and were in my opinion a little muddy sounding in comparison. They are a bit tight but suspect will loosen up  with break in. Overall pleased.

Now I won't have to drink 5 gallons of awful beer if I mess up! This kit is pretty foolproof though and my first batch is fermenting as I'm posting this. I ordered Brooklyn Brew Shop's Beer Making Book along with the kit and look forward to trying some of those recipes.<br /><br />Though there were no instructions packaged with the kit, it was pretty easy to find detailed instructions online.

14595,4,Y,Outdoors,B001OPH29W,Liberty Mountain Nylon Gaiter (Black),Gaiter Review - Keeping Dry,"I purchased the Gaiters as Christmas gifts last year so my daughter and I can enjoy snowshoeing without becoming cold and miserable with wet legs and feet.  Unfortunately, Mother Nature conspired to not snow very much here in southern Nevada last winter and limited our time in the snow.  This year; however, is a different story. A friend and I traveled to Bryce Canyon and Cedar Breaks National Monument during Veteran's Day weekend.  We drove into a significant snow storm and after the weather cleared we hiked in fresh snow at Cedar Breaks.  Long story short, I'm glad we packed the gaiters for the trip.  Cedar Break's recieved over two feet snow during the storm and got the chance to use the gaiters over our hiking boots.  Overall, these gaiters did the trick during the hiking at 10,000ft keeping us dry in deep snow - these gaiters ride high up to the knee which is perfect for tall folks, like me.  The only miss with these gaiters are the strapping mechanism going under the boots, essentially, a string that needs to knotted.  It was a little challenging squaring away the knot when the air temperature was around 0 dgs, but, we were able to get the gaiters secured and we move about the mountain with the greatest of easy and comfort.  Good product for those who are outdoor types and need to keep dry in wet/snow conditions."

We only need to use it every once in a while now.  Our Yorkie was only started barking when we brought home our chihuahua so we used it on him and he also stopped barking immediately.  Since it also has a beep we can also just press the beep button (when they are not wearing it) and they immediately associate the beep with the feeling of the collar so they stop barking.  I only bought this because of the previous reviews.  The cheap price had me hesitant but I'm glad I bought it.  It works and I'm glad we didn't have to spend a lot of money since it took a short time to get them to stop barking.

Setup took about 20 minutes and I had it running after putting the oil and some fuel in.  It starts on one or two pulls, and seems to sip fuel which is nice considering today's fuel prices.  The side attachment and bag both work great.  The front wheel drive is not the most desirable thing though - if you don't adjust the drive cable to make it more sensitive, you'll find the front wheels tend to spin out a little before catching - this just me nitpicking though.  But even if you dont use the self propelled feature, it's light enough to push without an issue.

So many of us have to settle for shortened versions. If you want an opinion of the story you found one. If you want to read me complain that this DVD shortens it, well that was it.  Lucia is a dreamer. One day she meets the man of her dreams, Jose Simon but he doesn't have eyes for her. She's poor and he's one of the wealthiest men in Peru. While working at a flower shop she meets Roberto, whom she believes is also poor. She initially doesn't like him but soon they become friends. What Lucia does not know is that he is actually Jose Simon's brother and also wealthy. In a series of misunderstandings Lucia re-meets Jose Simon, but this time as an Italian countess. He immediately falls for her, or is it for her money? Now Lucia must decide if she loves the wealthy Jose Simon or the poor Roberto?  This novella ranks up in my top 3 of all time. While you don't get to see the entire series they do a decent job of showing you how things transpire. If you are debating getting this after never seeing I recommend you go for it. If you were a fan of the original run, well be ready to see it shortened."

It didn't come with instructions, but they were easy to find via google. I would have had it running within 10 minutes had I known the power supply needed to be slightly modded with a paperclip in order to turn on when not connected to a motherboard. But now its all working wonderfully on a corsair cx500 psu ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0092ML0MY/ ). I had no idea what kind of bandwidth these would use, and had worried that my normal home connection would not be enough.

More than a biography he creates a critical overview of the work with an analysis of its strength and weakness. For Ellington the orchestra was his instrument and this book is as complex as its many members and relationships. None more so that his exploited, brilliant altar ego the composer and arranger Billy Strayhorn. Teachout reveals that typically Ellington failed to credit his collaborators and kept the royalties for his music to fund the expense of keeping the well paid band on the road. This portrait of a genius of jazz is less than flattering but unflinching in its depth, insight and honesty. It is overall the best book possible on a complex subject."

(I'm trying to keep my Bichon Frise puppy off of the carpet until she is potty trained.)  Was working in another room, and there she was beside me wanting to help.  I checked, and the gate was closed.  Found she is small enough to get between the bars - all hair and tiny body! Wrapped each section with plastic wrap.

14687,4,Y,Automotive,B003VXN62W,UnderCover SC301P SwingCase Passenger Side Storage Box,Better than anything else,"Got this for 2005 Dakota. Looks good, works well. My disappointment is that the catch that holds the case tight against the wall is a separate piece, which requires alignment and some guesswork. My pickup has a couple of extra holes in the side of the bed where I had to move the catch and align it correctly.<br /><br />I want to say that this is specific to my model. Other swing cases have a one-piece mounting bracket; this would earn a 5/5 rating. The shape of the Dakota bed prevents use of the one-piece and requires a separate catch, which must be aligned by the installer (you).<br /><br />This swing case is a good product, and the engineers did the best they could to make it work with a Dodge Dakota. Just know that it won't be as good and easy as it is on some other models. No reservations about buying again, just know what you're buying."
14689,4,Y,Musical Instruments,B0002H0D58,Rogue RA-100D Dreadnought Acoustic Guitar Black,Best bang for the $,"I'd like to give this guitar 5 stars, but it's just too cheap! There's lots of clues suggesting where corners were cut to keep this price point, but the sound of this guitar IS NOT one of them.<br /><br />I bought this without a demo based on price and reviews and couldn't believe how good it sounded out of the box. When people say it sounds better than any $200 starter guitar, they're telling the truth.<br /><br />The things I haven't read from others are how brutal the factory setup and Martin strings (as nice as they sound) are on your fingers. It came with the action set WAY TOO HIGH. I was afraid that if I adjusted the truss bar and changed to light strings that it wasn't going to maintain its sound.  I was wrong.  I swapped out the Martin strings for Ernie Ball Earthwood 80/20 Light, and lowered the action by at least one full revolution of the truss bar, and it sounds even better now. AND it's much more playable.<br /><br />Even considering the price, this is not a 5 star instrument.  If you don't know how, or aren't comfortable making adjustments yourself, you'd probably spend as much to get it set up as you paid for it.  Otherwise, I would think any beginner would lose interest trying to tame this thing for any length of time. The spruce top alone is worth the extra $25 over the RA-90D, but its still a laminate, and despite the sound that it makes, it's clearly thrown together as quickly and easily as the plant in China can turn them out. It looks OK, but it's not a show piece, and parts of the structure look crude. I have little hope that it'll still be playable in 5 or more years. But at this price, who cares?"

The harness sold to me by iJDM is perfect as it is exactly what I need. It could be used as an extension or a replacement for your factory harness. My only gripe about the harness I received, is the wire wasn't crimped perfectly so there is live cable exposed.

It is fool-proof in terms of how to lock it up - there is only one locking mechanism to close the top of the bag, so it's never left too far open for a sneaky hand to reach in.  Material is sturdy, easily wiped down if dirty.  This was recommended by full-time travelers, and I find it a very affordable &#34;insurance plan&#34; for my valuables.

14788,5,N,Video DVD,B000B5XOSO,Batman Returns (Two-Disc Special Edition),Great Sequel,"I love this sequel.  It is one of the few sequels that measures up to the first.  Batman is still a very conflicted guy.  Then Selena Kyle is a mild wimpy secretary who knows a little self-defense.  After she gets pushed out of a window, saved by some cats she becomes changed and the secret part of her that was hidden away comes out to play.  The Penguin is a slightly sympathetic but in general evil and sadistic.  I love Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman.  She is both a good guy and a bad guy and not very manipulative.  I love because she is a complete b**ch, but in a good way.  No one pushes her around and those that do she gets even with.  Although she and Batman do start a relationship she can't deny who she truly is and she would rather be that than be with him.  The Penguin gets his comeuppance.  Selena gets even with Max who pushed her out of the window. Batman aka Bruce knows at the end that she is still roaming the streets and he can count her to be an ally as long as he doesn't get in her way!"

14805,2,Y,Tools,B002YK9LA4,GearWrench 85989 17 Piece GearBox Master Set Metric,Not what I expected.,"I've heard great things about these wrenches for a while and couldn't wait to get a set of my own. Unfortunately, I'm pretty disappointed.  First, the blow mold case is exactly like the pic (which I guess makes sense) - there's no top, just what you see, which doesn't really make any sense, but whatever - I wouldn't take a star off for that.  I'm dropping stars because the sizing isn't right.  I've used the 10, 14, 17, and 18 so far.  The 18 is way off on the bolts I used it on (front suspension on my car).  The 5 deg. ratcheting does you no good if you've got 15 deg. of slop in the fit.  For the record, the bolt was an 18, and my other wrenches and sockets fit it perfectly.  The 10 was off as well, but not nearly as bad as the 18, and the others were close but still worse than most of my other tools.<br /><br />The other reason I drop a star is because they're flimsy and skinny.  With an XL set like this you expect more heft.  When I'm really pulling on the wrench it feels like it's going to flip over or crumple or something.  There's plenty of strength in the direction you need, but the thinness in the other direction doesn't inspire me to really pull on them, which is the point of an XL wrench.<br /><br />The good: They appear well made, nice finish, well marked, the ratcheting mechanism is crisp and solid.  The bad doesn't come out until you go to use it, and then it's just disappointing."

Includes Hard Travel Case.,Great purchase!,"So, I got these to take on vacation, so I could listen to my music without disturbing others and I love them. When turned on, they have a blue light that blinks every few seconds, but I asked and that did not bother those around me, and I can't see it unless I'm in front of a mirror or in a dark room. I'm no audiophile, but the bass sounds solid to me and the mids and highs are crisp enough for me. I have not had to charge them since the initial charge, and that was two weeks ago. I listen for 1-3 hours a day. The controls are not as intuitive as I'd like, simply because they are exactly the same on each side, so if I forget which side the volume is on I can accidentally skip forward or back a track by using the those controls on the other side. They are very comfortable, and I wear glasses, even, but after about 3 hours I'm ready to take them off. I've taken calls on them and the person on the other end says it sounds fine, but it sounds a little funny to me because my voice is muffled and I'm always afraid I'm talking really loudly.

14912,5,N,Sports,B00JU8GYT4,KettleX Intermediate Workout with Lorna Kleidman (Tutorial Included),A solid workout routine,"I've been using Kettlebells for ~ 15 years as part of my martial arts routine and know firsthand how useful these things can be for both men and women who want to strengthen and stabilize their core, burn fat, and build muscle. Sure, weights can do the same thing, but Kettlebells have certain advantages, not the least of which is that they're fun and easy to use. The kettlebell's center of mass is extended beyond the hand, hence utilizes more muscles than traditional dumbbells, meaning that a kettlebell workout is more effective and yields better results in less time too. What I hadn't found until now was useful instruction for those who have played around with them but want something more. Lorna Kleidman clearly knows her stuff, she is a 3-time Kettlebell World Champion, author, and coach, and it shows in the instruction. Ignoring the tutorial (~ 20 min) which you'll only need a couple of times, the DVD has a ~40 minute exercise routine, and ~ 4 minute cool down covering intermediate Kettlebell exercises. This makes for a well-produced, easy to follow, useful workout. You will need two Kettlebells for this routine (Lorna suggests ~ 10-15lb and 20-25lb for woman and ~ 15-20lb and 30-35lb for men) and a mat or towel, all of which are easily available at most any sporting goods store or online."

In general I have no complaints. After calibration it looks great, great high res, big screen. BUT - the biggest problem with this monitor is light bleed from the top and bottom. Honestly I would stay away from this monitor I you are a heavy movie/Netflix watcher. It is quite distracting and effects 2"" of the top and bottom of the screen. Also the colors are no where near as vibrant as my 32"" Samsung tv. So if you are gaming, I would recommend still recommend a tv.

15042,4,Y,Camera,B0038QYRDO,Celestron 52268 C90 Mak Spotting scope (Black),Good beginner scope to learn what you don't know.,"I am a neophyte with telescopes and decided that for what I want to do, this would be a good entry model for me.  I was mostly interested in looking at and photographing the moon, maybe some planets, and possible use it for other celestial background photo work.  It was also a shot at getting my feet wet before I plopped down thousands of dollars to find out I got the wrong stuff.  Turns out this is a good choice to cut my teeth and learn lessons.  The unit is fairly rugged, self-contained, and more or less sealed so you can't accidentally mess something up.  It is heavy...too heavy for even the best camera tri-pod.  Combine that with the Earth's habit of rotating objects out of your field of view fairly quickly, you need a specifically designed tri-pod to handle it.  I got the one from Celestron with the azimuth controls so once I get the moon in the telescopes sights, I can rotate some knobs and keep it in view.  That works well without having to invest in a &#34;clock&#34; type mount.  Photography can be done a couple of ways without investing in those purpose built units which are big on price tags and low in resolution.  The first way is to use an adapter to mount a digital SLR body to the unit. The second is what I did, which is another adapter from Celestron that allows you to mount a point-and-shoot type digital camera behind the eyepiece.  I used an Olympus TG-2 which worked really well, once you got everything aligned.  In some ways, using the rear display of the camera is easier to find and keep your subject in frame.  As for the actual quality of the image, I am not an expert.  It seems very crisp to me and I don't seem to see any color issues.  What is important is setting the unit up correctly.  You need to use some local object to &#34;sight in&#34; the cross-hairs in the spotter scope to match what you see in the telescope.  Once that is done, it is far easier to find your astronomical targets.  It is still weird getting used to the idea of getting my eyes aligned directly behind the eyepiece and about an inch away from it.  I also like that the image is &#34;right side up&#34; like a binocular view rather than the flipped over version most telescopes have.  This will allow me to use it for nature viewing as well.  This unit will get me through my learning phase until I know better what I want and how much money I am willing to spend.  I have attached two photos.  One is of the telescope on the tripod with the digital camera adapter.  The other is the first photo of the moon I took with it."

15107,3,N,Beauty,B008KEJ1LM,"Panasonic Milano All-in-One Trimmer, ER-GB40-S, for Beard and Mustache, with 19 Trim Adjustable Settings, Cordless, Wet/Dry",Decent but nothing spectacular,"bought this after my Philips QT4050 broke from fall down a flight of stairs.  I found this on sale at Future Shop and decided to get this over the another 4050.<br /><br />I would rate this 2.5 out of 5, but Amazon doesn't allow that, and I think it is closure to a 3 then a 2.  For every positive this razor has a negative.<br /><br />As far as the charging stand goes, if you are someone that likes to keep things on top of your counter this is possibly the nicest looking trimmer and stand on the market.  I personally don't, after it's finished charging I place it in the drawer, but if looks are important, this trimmer gets a 5 in the department.<br /><br />The charging stand does have a negative.  The light on the stand only indicates that charger is actually on the stand correctly.  The light on the stand will either be on, meaning the trimmer is on the stand, or the light will be off.  The light is only red, it will not change colors when it is done charging, nor will it turn off.<br /><br />When fully charged this has an incredible battery life, however the trimmer does not have any indicator to let you know when the battery is dying or how much life you have left.  This is a huge negative, since this trimmer can only be used as a cordless.  There is no option to use a cord, the trimmer can only be charged by sitting on the stand.  If the trimmer starts to die before you are finished, you are out of luck.<br /><br />The motor on this is very quite.  It is easily the quickest one I've every owned.  However, that benefit is probably achieved by under powering the motor.  I found the 4050 to have a little more power, which means the 4070 which is also cheaper then this, may have a lot more power then this.  I found myself having to do some extra passes with this.<br /><br />The biggest benefit of this trimmer is probably the fact that you can use it in the shower, and clean it by running water through it.  The draw back is the maintenance that is required because ofthis.  In a time when more and more trimmers are becoming Maintenance-free, this trimmer requires you to oil it's blades both before and after each use.  With that said, I still find it faster to wash this under water and apply 3 drops of oil, then have to clean the trimmer with a brush.<br /><br />I actually like the comb, it feels fine against my face and doesn't scratch.  However taking it off does feel odd sometimes, and sometimes it does feel like you have to force it off and it might break.  With that said the trimmer does feel like it is solidly made, so maybe it's something I'll get us to.<br /><br />As for the price.  I do think this is overpriced.  I live in Toronto, Canada.  At Future Shop this was priced regularly at $69, the Philips 4050 was at $49 and the 4070 at 64.  I got it on sale for 59.  I would not buy this for regular price, and honestly if I had to replace it, I wouldn't spend $59 on again either.  This shouldn't be price more then Philips 4050 at $49.<br /><br />In the end, like I mentioned at the top, this is a decent trimmer, but is nothing to write home about, and it is very overpriced.  It has some nice benefits, but also some huge negatives.  It does the job, but there are trimmer that do just as good of a job at a lot cheaper price."

15152,5,N,Musical Instruments,B00006I5R7,Sennheiser E835 Dynamic Cardioid Vocal Microphone,Excellent quality in a competitive price range,"Like several other reviewers I'd been using SM58's until trying these out and was blown away. We use these for vocals in both a rehearsal studio environment and live performance. They run thru dbx 286A preamp/compressor/gates in normal use but when we got the first one I a/b tested it against the Shure straight into the console as well. Here's my rundown:  * sonically they have wider response, just a little bit more at the bottom and noticeably more extension at the top. To my ears it's slightly warm but with a good sense of air, not rolled-off.  * very good off-axis rejection, this mic has practically eliminated feedback issues for us without resorting to hard gating like I had to with the 58's. On the other hand, our singers have to remember to sing more directly into the mic. Minimal proximity effect as well. Plosives are well controlled, about the same as the Shure.  * sturdy construction, minimal handling noise, good weight balance, feels slightly heavier than the 58.  * first reaction when the band saw them was ""ooo sexy"". I dunno about sexy but it IS a nice looking mic.  Overall these are a nice improvement. I have now replaced my 58's with e835's and could hardly be happier with the results. Microphone qualities are highly subjective so listen to both back to back if at all possible, and decide for yourself! The e835 may not be right for you but in my case have exceeded expectations."

15166,1,Y,Luggage,B001CZMY06,"Travelon Cabin Comfort Inflatable Pillow, Grey, One Size",Not for the economy class traveller,"First, this item is huge before it is inflated and there is really no way to efficiently store it.  It takes up way too much space in your carry on luggage.  If it was incredibly comfortable or useful, it might be worth it it, but it isn't.  I never used it on my 16 hour flight as once it was inflated, I really had to stay in that position because if the seats next to you are full, there is no place to easily place it if you want quickly grab the earphones you dropped or something like that.  Also, it kind of makes the person next to you claustrophobic when in use because it completely boxes them in as well.  It is really just too cumbersome for economy class travel between fitting it in your luggage, inflating it and using it.  I wish I wouldn't have bought it as I will never use it again.  I don't think it is the brand but just the item itself."

Although I'm not sure how important this will be in the long run, I really like that the watch has illumination on the second hand.  You can't beat the price ($188) for a watch with a great pedigree that is rated for 200 meters water resistance.  It would be nice if it had a sapphire crystal and a screw-down crown but then the price would jump substantially.    Update 1/12/15:  With all the negative reviews about parts falling off in a short period of time I just wanted to report that after two weeks nothing has broken and the watch passed a two hour submersion test."

15266,5,N,Kitchen,B0047BIWSK,Aeropress Coffee and Espresso Maker,Love the Americana Style This Makes,"Love this thing.  Tips:<br />1.) I start with a very fine (expresso) grind (2 scoops)<br />2. Water in the kettle until just before it sings.  For me this gives about 185 f water<br />3.) Have the plunger at the ready:<br />  A.)  When you pour the water, quickly stir then put the plunger on top and just enough to seal<br />  This keeps the water from seeping out too quickly<br />4.) After about 10-15 seconds, plunge away<br />5.) Top-off with more hot water and bam! Great coffee<br /><br />I generally drink mine black.  If you like black flavorful coffee but don't appreciate that burn in your throat from the harshness you get from auto-drip, you'll be happy with this.<br /><br />Also, for iced coffee:<br /> * Same method as above but don't worry about topping off.  Just mix cream and sugar to taste to the coffee while it's hot. Then pour over ice.<br /><br />Cheers!"
15268,5,N,Electronics,B008AWDCDW,SOL REPUBLIC 1102-61 AMPS In-Ear Headphones with 1-Button Remote and Microphone - Black,I was a pretty committed SkullCandy user,"I didn't buy these headphones from Amazon but I got it new from our campus bookstore.  Before I started using the SOL AMPS, I was a pretty committed SkullCandy user.  Specifically I had the SkullCandy Ink'd 2 and Smokin' Buds 2.  I honestly didn't have any problem with these except for the occasional times when they will fall apart.  I got the SOL AMPS for fun and I'm really glad I picked them out and this is why...<br /><br />DESIGN<br />I wanted something different from SkullCandy and I thought the style of these looked fun and unique.  The SOL logo on the side definitely looks attractive.  I also like how the buds are angled so you can get a better fit.  I was a little worried about the outer part being abnormally large and odd when they are in my ears, but it doesn't really bother me, and in fact it feels very comfortable...<br /><br />COMFORT<br />These are one of the best fitting ear headphones I've ever tried.  They are so comfortable that I sometimes forget I have them in my ears when the music isn't playing.  While the SkullCandy buds fits me fairly well, they don't fit other people when they ask to borrow my SkullCandy headphones.  However, the fitting of the SOL AMPS is perfect.  It feels very snug.  I have exercised (ex. running on treadmill, weightlifting, biking, etc.) using both SkullCandy and SOL AMPS and the SOL AMPS are superior by far.  I never feel like they are going to fall out no matter how much I sweat or move.  These headphones are definitely a plus in comfort.<br /><br />SOUND QUALITY<br />The switch from SkullCandy to SOL AMPS is phenomenal.  I feel like I can hear a crisp sound compared to SkullCandy.  I love SkullCandy and thought it was great but wow these definitely give an additional boost to the bass.  The bass isn't overwhelming and it sounds just right.  I'm a person who listens a WIDE range of music (ex. Electronic, Rap, Country, to Classical) and the quality doesn't sound lost in all of the genres.<br /><br />MIC and VOLUME<br />I've used this for calls and skype and I never have problems talking or hearing people.  I sometimes have to hold the mic portion close to my mouth to make myself clearer but this isn't really a problem for me.  This is definitely a nice feature.<br /><br />Having the controls for the volume is so wonderful.  It definitely eliminates the hassle of taking taking out your phone (I have an iPhone) to adjust the volume or even shuffling music.  I use these buttons (almost as an abuse) because that's how convenient they are.  When I am using the SOL AMPS on the bus or any public areas, I never hear any background noises and in addition I can have the volume high without bothering the person who is next to me.<br /><br />PRICE<br />I bought these for a little more than what it is selling on Amazon.  I think these headphones are definitely worth the price!  I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a treat to an enjoyable experience.  Good job Sol Republic!"

The instruction manual is fair and fairly confusing until you learn that it is written in a catch all fashion. The unit is easy to set up, nearly plug-n-play. The remote is light with good-sized buttons (well labeled). When transferring a film from your tape library to disc, be prepared for a fuzzy outcome. The picture will appear as though in slightly diffused light. This is because the VCR unit isn't top quality. Not enough reading heads. But the audio will knock your socks off! It's a very small hitch in your get along, though. You do not have to try to re-purchase that rather large library you built up over twenty plus years. With a little effort, just a few hours, you'll get the hang of how to transfer images, create titles and menus, and how to finalize your discs so that they can be played on any other DVD player.

I put this teething necklace around her ankle (wrapped twice) rather than around her neck because I thought it would be safer. I really like that each stone on this necklace is individually knotted, it makes it so much safer when dealing with a child that is in the pulling on everything stage. I love that this came with a silicone teether for her to chew on as well! I believe that we are seeing a difference in her due to the necklace, but I cannot be sure if it is the necklace, the teether, or her teeth finally coming in that is causing the change in her. I am going to give this amber teething necklace the benefit of the doubt because she did not start calming down until she had it on. I was given the chance to test this baltic amber teething necklace as part of a promotion."

I hung this horizontally and the pull from the hanger wire caused the top and bottom sections of frame to bow outward.

Many reviewers will note that it is too narrow to span two studs.  My installation was a brick wall on the exterior of my house so this was not an issue.  The included anchors worked great for this.  Drill a 3/8 hole for the anchors, NOT the slightly larger M10 that is recommended in the instructions.  I drilled 3/8 with intentions to enlarge the hole from there but found the anchors fit almost loose in the smaller hole and any larger would have been a problem. Also, for any led small enough for this bracket will work fine in drywall with the anchors.  My 32in is only 10.1 pounds, and many 40&#34; led TVs are around 19 pounds  You need a hammer drill to drill into concrete or brick!  You will burn up masonry bits and spend hours fighting it with a regular drill.  With a hammer drill installing this will be a 15 minute job.  I don't know if the product has changed or not, but after reading reviews of this being thin and cheap I can say there is no way mine is the same as theirs, you can't mistake this for cheap.  It's easily up to its rating.  It comes with tons of screw sizes to mount to your TV, except M4 like I needed.  .80cents at home depot and this this was ready to roll."

Bought these before my first RV trip, and used them often on our 4 month trip around the US. Don't need them on level ground. Once, I was on fairly unlevel ground and only used regular chocks as I was a little lazy. Jacked up the tongue and the thing slid off the blocks I had under it ! Ever since then, if I am at all concerned about slippage, I put in one or sometimes both of these and the TT won't move a millimeter. They would be perfect if they somehow had a &#34;release&#34; that would allow you to collapse or expand them quickly, then only have to use the included ratchet wrench to tighten or loosen them the rest of the way. If you only have a tight space to store them, its annoying to have to crank them down to make them small. I ended up using my electric drill with the same socket as that for the stabilizer jacks on the trailer to quickly open or close them."

15632,4,Y,Furniture,B001EBBDO6,Linon Chelsea Nook,Nice affordable furniture.,"For the price, this is a nice little breakfast set. It is lightweight and soft wood, so I don't expect it to last forever.  My kids can be pretty hard on furniture, so I intentionally buy things that are less expensive so I won't be devastated when they get damaged, and this fits the bill nicely.  The instructions are excellent - very easy to follow, and the hardware is packaged nicely so you don't lose any necessary pieces.  My only complaint is that when it came to the very end of the assembly, the corner back rest does not have pre-drilled holes to screw into the other back pieces.  You will definitely want to pre drill the holes, or you risk splitting the wood.  It took about 4 hours to assemble the whole set (with some distractions).

15677,4,Y,Video Games,B003RDEV8E,PS3 Move Charge Station Quad Port Charging Dock,"Don't Love it, but Definitely Like it Enough for 4 stars","So right off the bat, no, I have not tried EVERY PS Move charger there is out there as there are many, but this Nyko charger seemed the best deal for the most punch. I mean, think about it - it is one of the very FEW PS Move chargers that has 4 ports which could charge any Move controller interchangeably (as in, up to 4 motion controllers or 4 navigation controllers, or mix n' match). Another thing that attracted me was its look, kinda has this cool ""tube"" thing going on, and looks like it can solidly hold any of the controllers. It also uses light indicators to let you know when something is mid-charge, or done charging. Lastly but definitely not least, out of all the Move chargers available here on Amazon, it is the most affordable. I got a great deal by a great used dealer on here and am very happy with my transaction. No, I didn't get an original box, but don't need it.<br /><br />Anyway, so how this thing works is that you basically slide in the controller and the 2 sensors that are located on the bottom of these controllers touch the sensors at the base of these tubes, and once contact is made the charging commences. The tube itself is made of a clear plastic, and the base is black with an LED underneath (nothing crazy, a small blue thing). It has an on/off button at the front of the base, so when you are ready to charge, just hit the button, and the tubes turn red while the controller is charging. The LED light already on the controllers also blinks to let you know it is charging. Once the item is fully charged the tube goes from a red light color to a bright white (which actually looks rather cool). Once it's white, you know it's done, you pull the controller out, and you commence your playtime. The base itself plugs into the wall via AC plug that comes separate and plugs into the base. That's pretty much it. It works well enough, looks quite pretty, and even with no controllers in it does serve as a pretty cute and decorative piece.<br /><br />So onto the complaints, which aren't heavy at all but still significant enough to write about. First, the unit feels rather cheap. It's very light, and feels kinda like a flimsy plastic. I wouldn't want to drop this thing because it may very well break, the thing just feels too delicate to ever risk being dropped or mistreated in any way. Next, the thing seems to have a bit of confusion as to when something is actually done charging. By that I mean, you could have a controller inside and have it light red for about 10 minutes, then see it white. You pop it out and figure the job is done. If you put it right back inside (let's say if you just want to use the tube as a storage space, the light will turn red again and take anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute for it to turn white again. It almost makes it seems like it has trouble reading (or is slow to read) when something is actually done charging. This isn't a big deal except that it MAY cause confusion as to knowing which controller is charge and which isn't. I myself own 2 nav controller and 2 motion controllers. As far as this thing ""over charging"" if the item is left in too long after indicating that is done charging, I am not exactly sure. When my controllers are done charging I simply take the controllers out. I didn't want to keep the controllers inside and take the risk.<br />Aside from this little quirk, there was a strange glitchy action mine did upon the first time I used it. I would put all the controllers inside, and while it was still charging (tubes were red lighted), the lights would turn off and the base blue light would come on as if the controllers were all pulled out, even though they were all in the tubes. The base blue light only turns on when there are no controllers inserted. Basically the thing was not reading my controllers even though they were in there. I turned if off and back on again and it did it again. I had remembered then that these 2 controllers that we were playing with prior on a separate game had already been fully charged, I had just simply left them in there to sit, which I stopped doing. After a second try, everything went back to normal. I just decided to ignore this as it didn't happen again. But thing DID start to work properly after a few minutes.<br />There have also been complaints that it is annoying plugging in the nav controllers, that they need to be played around with and slightly shaken or ""Jimmied"" in order for the sensor to catch notice. I DID face this issue a couple of times but honestly, the thing was so minor that I wasn't even going to put this in the review. It took 2 seconds to get the thing to sit right.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're on a budget and just want something quick and easy, this Nyko chargers not only looks cool but also works in a necessary way. While these little strange glitches sort of just happen out of a whim, it doesn't really affect the necessity for such a cute item. If you HAVE the means, and would rather pick up a Sony brand PS Move charger (the one with only 2 port holes) I would probably recommend that one over this one only because it IS the Sony official brand, and it wouldn't feel flimsy and cheap. Still, lots of Move players don't want to plug in only 2 controllers and they wait to take turns from the others; this is well enough, I would suggest checking out the official brand name. I bought these because they were very cheap and affordable, as well as look good. If you're on a budget, I would these above the others: but if you've got the dough, pick yourself up a Wii or something.<br /><br />So just to recap some pros and cons:<br /><br />PROS:<br />-More affordable than the other 4 port chargers<br />-Good looks<br />-Light LED charge indicators<br />-Functional, charging does not take long<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Cheap/delicate feeling plastic<br />-Random glitchy tendencies<br />-Very minor issues getting the nav controllers to sit right"

15680,2,N,Baby,B0052QYLUM,Infant Optics DXR-5 Portable Video Baby Monitor,Returning it right away,"The baby monitor arrived expeditiously as every other product I buy from Amazon.  As soon as you open the box, you realize that the quality of the materials is substandard.  The monitor is made of cheap plastic, and the back clip/stand will not stand to the test of daily use.  On the positive side, the monitor has a really big screen, but that is where the positive ends.  This product was evidently not engineered with the end user in mind:<br /><br />(1) It lacks a video on/off switch.  If you turn the VOX on, the video will turn off after three minutes of silence, so if you want to check on your sleeping baby you would have to turn the VOX off.  If you leave the VOX off, the video will be on constantly, draining your battery and disrupting your sleep.<br /><br />(2) There is no battery charge meter so that you can track your battery life.<br /><br />(3) The camera has red lights around it that turn on when the infrared is on, potentially disturbing your baby's sleep.<br /><br />(4) If you want to toggle between two cameras, you have to go through the entire 4-camera cycle every time.  The monitor should ""know"" how many cameras you have paired and only cycle through those.<br /><br />(5) Forget about monitoring two babies in different rooms simultaneously.  Unless you stay awake all night and cycle through your different cameras every so often, the camera the monitor will ignore the camera that is not selected.  If you fell asleep with the monitor looking at baby #1 you will never know when baby #2 wakes up crying at 3AM.  There should be a function that ""listens"" to all cameras and feeds video of the camera that picks up noise.<br /><br />Bottom line, we are returning this product."

15767,2,Y,Tools,B0009JXRFC,Smith & Wesson CK105H Extreme Ops Knife,Locking device defective,"The knife has potential but I'm surprised Smith and Wesson allows their name to be associated with this Chinese made toy. The internal locking frame does not engage thereby making the knife less than safe. It is nice and light and the edge only needs to be touched up slightly to make it sharp enough to be serviceable. I attempted to take the thing apart to grind down the locking device to make it work but I don't have enough small torx bits that fit to get the job done. I purchased the knife to give to a young nephew but cannot knowingly give something that may cause a severe accident to anyone. I will keep the knife to use around the work shop, I grew up with non-lock-blade knives but things like this are unacceptable. No matter how inexpensive something is the basic safety feature must be tested and work before it is allowed to leave the factory."

I bought it so the dogs could come and go as they pleased and so we could get a fresh breeze in the house every so often. The screen material seems pretty sturdy and it keeps the bugs out.

It does not press against my eyelids and is therefore, very comfortable as I fall asleep. The contoured shape does have to be in just the right position to ensure no light comes in, but that doesn't bother me. I like the idea of the velcro straps, but sometimes my hair gets a little caught in them. Again, that doesn't bother me. I only use these on long flights, and occasionally on the weekends, so that I am not awakened by the sun on days that I can sleep in. I would definitely recommend these."

Amazon screwed up, or at least their database did, and sent the wrong address for shipping; all four items went to the wrong address. To Amazon's credit, they re-shipped the goods they had in inventory, but told me they couldn't help with the 3rd party vendor from which the carvers were coming. Seems to me that if Amazon's database screwed up the order (it was an address that I lived at THREE moves ago and which wasn't tied to my credit card) and sent the 3rd party vendor the wrong address, Amazon should make it right. I had ordered several books just a couple of months prior, and they all came to the correct address like these should have, so it wasn't a matter of me not updating my account, THAT had been done correctly. I won't recommend buying anything from Amazon until they stand up and take responsibility for THEIR error."

Great concept.<br />2. Poorly manufactured.<br /><br />Over time (about 50 hours of use), the black handle came off the chrome/metal. I ALMOST lost my ContourHD camera in the ocean! As I lengthen the pole, the black handle separated from the chrome pipe. I could not put the handle back securely. The other major issue was the two plastic molds where the tripod screwed came out of - SEE VIDEO. This is a MAJOR problem and do not recommend this pole/stick because the molds joining is poorly manufactured and unable to sustain normal stress causing the joined structure to separate and your camera to wiggle at the end of the pole.

It was huge and heavy, the bed went to life immediately after we pulled off the vacuum plastic wrap, we let it sit the whole day and by the end of the day it has pretty much reached its max expansion, 14 inch is really thick, I'm glad we went for the that size for I wanted a really high bed almost to my hip level.

They are such a convenient size to store practically anywhere.    Then came the wheels that made me a different person....  in a bad way...    It seems so simple.  Push each wheel into each hole on the bottom.  Oh my lord.  I pushed, jiggled, shimmied, murked, rocked, crunked, wiggled, grinded, twerked, got jiggy and did the Macarena to try to get a wheel in a hole and it took years off my life.  For the love of Jesus, Sterilite, can you make the holes just a tiny bit bigger or lower the endowment of those wheel pegs???    Once you do get them in, they still don't look like they're fully in, but it's ok, because by then you don't care and you're at a point mentally where you surrender to a Higher Power, and thus find peace.  In fact, I found God because of these wheels!    Once you flip it over it rolls great.  You may even have to run after it and catch it, such as on hardwood.

My solution-duct tape!  I put duct tape on the back of the chair where the tray connects so it won't go down when my baby is sitting in it.  This works but if you take the chair down each time after eating then you will have to put the duct tape there and remove it when you put it away.  I just keep my chair up in my kitchen...

Francis Slakey begins his quest with a goal in mind - set a record, to be the first man to climb the highest mountain on every continent and to surf every ocean. The challenge he sets out in front of him seems simple at the time: 8 peaks, 4 shorelines, 12 experiences to check off his To Do List. He is driven by his indifference to the world to shrug it off in this independent series of adventures. The world, as it turns out, would have none of that.<br /><br />Slakey is brutally honest about his own agenda, and about how he failed others in following it. At first he failed others, that is. But as he slowly began to open himself up to the amazing experiences surrounding him at every turn, his agenda changed. He changed. He found that it was possible to evolve from someone serving himself to someone serving others. And he didn't do it with a mushy gushy love story, although love was present. He did it by finding that man within himself, the one that always existed. Just as he encourages us to do, simply by telling his story.<br /><br />Inspirational and exciting, follow Francis Slakey as he scales mountains, crosses plains of ice, hunkers down during blizzards, and dodges bullets in an around-the-world adventure that is like none the average joe will ever have. Slakey shares with us his most amazing experiences and his darkest moments and through it all we discover a man we can all learn from. Read it for the adventure, sure, but take away from it the perspective.<br /><br />I received this book for free through the Goodreads First Reads program."

I figured it would take after the E Tool issued to Soldiers in the US Army, since it takes after that design. It is at least 1/3 to 1/2 smaller than an E Tool. If used to dig a hasty firing position or foxhole, better plan ahead and bring along a case of Red Bull, because you are going to be digging there quite a long while. Otherwise, it's light weight, easily packable in a backpack or in a vehicle for emergency use. It can be used as a machete for cutting through light to moderate brush, the attached pick can be used as a make-shift weapon to impale skulls of Zombies, or for powder blue UN Helmets if the need should arise. (Id recommend buying the United Cutlery M48 Tactical/Survival Shovel) Hope this helps."

I was a little surprised how expensive they were; though buying multiple filters was more economical, still a little steep. I decided to 'shop around' and discovered that Amazon carried them and the price was significantly cheaper. I received them (I ordered a 2-pk) and installed one, not too difficult. The water is clear and tastes better than from my tap (we have hard water with excess iron). I would definitely recommend this product."

We have had no issues with it at all--it's easy to set up and easy to use. Call quality and features are great.<br /><br />What has been especially wonderful about having Ooma is that it helped us ditch the costly monthly cable ""bundle"".<br /><br />Every month, I would feel ill about how much we were spending for cable/internet/phone. I didn't really feel like there were other great options out there and with the ""bundle"" we got from the cable company, it was our best choice. Then along came Ooma.<br /><br />We finally took the plunge and ditched our phone and cable and between the 2, we save over $800 a year. Now, I know that Ooma alone didn't save us that much, but having this option for our phone service really helped in maximizing how much we saved by doing this. The way they ""bundle"" services, I never felt like it was worth switching to anything else.<br /><br />I highly recommend Ooma."

The ""ez-cling"" aspect of them really is easy, I just kind of rub it on to the window and it sticks.  Sometimes, if I haven't rubbed it on well enough or if there are air bubbles, it will fall off, but I think that is more because of the angle of my rear window.  They are, after all, meant to be used on side windows, so I think that wouldn't be an issue there.  Also, they seem to provide the shade I wanted for my baby without completely blocking my view.  They aren't totally see-thru like a tinted film would be, though.  Over all, they do the job I want."

I purchased this unit (in October) a part of the Xbox360 Christmas gift for my son.  One of the fans died in less than 30 days.  For ten to thirty cents more during manufacturing a ball bearing fan, instead of a sleeve fan could have been used and the unit would have lasted much longer.  I sent an email to the manufacturer tonight asking for the exact size of the fan so I can order ball-bearing replacements for them.  That will make the unit quieter and allow it to last longer."

The armstrong,a 1/4 drive 14mm socket and a 3/8 to 1/4 drive adapter fit.  This is a tight fit only a thin head ratchet fits!This works to loosen bolt from top. If you flex ratchet you can get it from the front of engine. I like acessing the bolt from top.

This Epare is my favorite by far. It's a generous size and attractive design. It's as rugged as these can be and has lasted quite well. It hasn't leaked at all so far although I always hand wash it since it's so quick that way. I confess I broke one when I tipped over a blender jar and it unfortunately landed on my Epare but I can't blame the mug at all for that. It keeps my morning coffee nice and hot a lot longer than my other non-insulated mugs. One thing I noticed is you don't want to fill it all the way to the top or a little drips down the side with the first few sips. Just leave a half inch and you should be OK. It has this in common with the other brands I tried. I liked these enough to buy another set. Hope you enjoy them also."

You can even distinguish conversations clearly with high background. My only complain is the iCloud service, which is only good in the US and Canada, no international service available as yet. The other complain is that you cannot do local recording of your video, thus without the iCloud service you can only review realtime action. This is definitely not very useful for surveillance unless you keep checking you video constantly and risk your friends telling you &#34;get a life man, stop staring at your damn phone&#34;."

I just used it last night for a hot oil treatment and it works great. I use this cap for coloring my hair and for deep conditioning treatments. Using heat on my hair colors makes them last a very, very long time: I use semi-permanent hair colors and they can last 6 months or more. Heat for deep conditioning helps the conditioner penetrate, leaving my hair very soft and strong.<br /><br />My cap came with a small, thin plastic cap to use underneath it, to protect it from getting wet or sticky or stained. I lost that a few years ago so now I use a few plastic grocery bags.<br /><br />It gets very hot on the high setting, so I usually use it on medium or low. It gets the job done very well. I've worn it for hours at a time with no problems.<br /><br />Sometimes it makes a buzzing noise. At first I found that a little alarming, but no harm has ever come of it.<br /><br />I recommend this product to all my friends. It is a game-changer in hair care."

I know some complain about the smell, but it really depends where you store your drums. I practice in the garage and I don't smell the tire rubber smell at all (or it doesn't overpower the actual smell of my car tires). If you use them for an extended period of time and you pound on the drums, the rubber might rub off on the  drum. My only complaint is that it doesn't 100% resemble the bounce of a real drum head; and if I practice too long on these, my sticks are flying in the air because I need to adjust to the bounce of a real head. But, I can adjust this problem a few minutes into a gig or practice, it is better to have something I can practice on in the late hours of the night."

I do not to warn you away but I do want to highlight that it is handmade from scraps that may not be even. The bag I received has a single top stripe like the bags pictured, but it has a series of vertical stripes (in different colors) instead of the second solid stripe. The back is a dusty lavender, the top stripe is brown, and the sides are natural. Although the bag is on the smaller size, it is large enough for a Kindle or trade paperback as well as a few essentials."

I was very impressed with one really violent scene that had the potential to be nasty.  The author kept the intensity of the scene without being excessively graphic.<br /><br />There were a couple of minor grammatical errors that get lost in the story.

I have an MBA with a concentration in Marketing, and am working on a M.S. in Marketing now. That's why I bought the audio book - I thought it might be a nice supplement to my required coursework. I was wrong. There is some interesting content, and I haven't heard anything yet that I would say is incorrect. But, the biggest problem is that nothing seems practical or applicable. It's all very high-level, with no clear instruction or example on HOW to apply the concepts. But that's not why I'm giving only two stars. That's because of the constant irrelevant references to other topics in other chapters. It seems like every few minutes he spends a few minutes talking about what he's going to talk about in future chapters. Call me silly, but I always thought that's what a Table of Contents was for. The other irritating thing was the constant referrals to figures or tables in the book. I'm listening to the audiobook and obviously cannot see these. If you're going to release an audiobook, don't read the book - customize it for LISTENERS and describe what these images show! These last two issues became so annoying that I could not finish listening to this....I've deleted it off my phone."

16348,4,N,Video Games,B007XVTR3K,Call of Duty: Black Ops II - Xbox 360,Competitive for the Better,"Alright everybody knows what Call of Duty is really about and that is multiplayer. It is Treyarch's bread and butter and it makes people keep coming back for more. Yes there is zombies and campaign but multiplayer caters to most CoD fans out there so this review will be multiplayer biased. I can say that zombies are fun based on experience but I cannot say the same for the campaign for those interested.<br /><br />There is a new pick ten system which allows people to build a class catering to their play style. Personally I like this new approach as it allow me to play the way I want without certain in game limits. There is also a new mode called league play which puts players of equal ability next to each other. I really liked this because I would consistently get chopper gunners and high skill steaks in older games and as fun as that sounds to people it got old really fast.  I have been on the receiving end of high skill streaks too and understand that is just as good a reason to quit the game. Now by playing people of similar skill it is a challenge to win and there is a reward to keep playing the game! Additionally people who don't play as often will be placed with similar skill so there will be less frustration!<br /><br />People complain a lot about hit markers and lag but that is not been a problem for me. I've seen the youtube videos and it is often an excuse for bad play. The lag is minimal in this game, if there is lag it boots the host and gets a better connection. I play with best connection on all the time, which may be the solution to the lag issue. Also realize the Cod series has been out for a while and some people are seasoned vets so I recommend league play for new players as they will get matched with other new players looking to learn the ropes of the game.<br /><br />Treyarch has embraced the competitive community in this game more than ever. I like this mostly because the competitive community is likely to support the game till the end of its run.  I feel as though it is unjust to ignore the competitive community when casual gamers will have likely have moved on 3 months into release. Realize too the result of competitive gaming is a more balanced and clean playing game for everyone.<br /><br />Even if competitive isn't your fancy there is plenty to keep the casual gamer interested for quite a long time. 2/4 map packs have been released and zombies has been beefed up quite a bit since world at war. There is so much more to unlock and customize this time around.  Say what you want about the series, but nothing still beats going into a lobby with your friends (virtual or not) and wreaking havoc on the enemy. No other FPS does that better than Call of duty black ops 2 does today.<br /><br />Overall, campaign is a flop, but the zombies and multiplayer is the by far the best in the franchise."

16364,4,Y,Musical Instruments,B003EYV88M,Washburn WD25 Series WG26SCE Acoustic Electric Guitar,It's a jumbo cutaway...,"First of all, this is a beautiful guitar!  Great finish, beautiful wood, well made.  It's got very good tone, and plays easy right out of the box.  I also have a Gibson J-45, so I've got something to compare it to.  No, it doesn't sound as good as the Gibson, but for around $350, I wasn't expecting it to.  I bought this guitar because I wanted something different from my dreadnaught, and to have something that I didn't have to humidify.  I had one problem.  There was a buzz on the top string at the 12th fret.  Fortunately for me, I have a friend who is a luthier, and after some work to the frets, it sounds great!  Also I wasn't a fan of the stock strings, so I changed them out for my favorites (Elixir nano-webs), and found it playing better after that as well.  In short, beautiful guitar, especially for the money, very good tone, but may need some work to get it right.  Amazon has an easy return policy, so it would even be worth sending one back to get the next one right, if necessary."

It is the first SLR i've ever owned, and although it took a little practice and reading the manual (as with any new technology you buy) it was relatively easy to learn how to operate.  Keep your manual handy if you're just starting out.  I probably would not suggest the D5000 for someone who hasn't had ANY SLR experience before.  It can be intimidating at first, so I might suggest a more user-friendly or beginners version of a Nikon SLR.  After learning how to use this camera, i absolutely love it, it is my baby.  At first I had some trouble with grainy images, but learning the proper ISO settings changes everything.  There isn't really anything I can think of (or have tried) that this camera can't do.  Along with my laptop, this camera is probably the best purchase I have ever made, and it is well worth the money, and its weight in gold."

16394,5,Y,Home,B002N88LWG,America's Cup Columbia 1901 - Handcrafted Sailing Ship Model - Small - French Finish - Table Stand Included - Authentic Models AS108,America's Cup Columbia Model Yacht - very nice but assembly required - which is half of the fun!,"I was tempted to give only 4 stars but I can't do it. I love this model yacht. I think the price is right for such a significant sized model. It is as large as an oven door or fireplace opening to put it into perspective. The only gripe I have was the size was actually larger than what was displayed on Amazon when I bought it. But this has since been corrected. It is 37&#34; high WITH the stand...the stand adds 2&#34; to the height - and you definitely need the stand. I bought it for an indoor window I have in my home and it barely fits...but still awesome.<br /><br />Assembling the model is a little bit of work. If you are impatient or have really large fingers or hands, this may not be for you. If you like puzzles and want to make an evening out of putting this together, you should go for it. I would suggest pouring a glass of wine or hot tea and make it a date night with your loved one when putting this together!<br /><br />I used photos from the Amazon.com site on my iPad when assembling the boat. I will upload photos of my completed model to assist others in the future. The iPad app only shows the photos provided by the seller...but if you go to www.amazon.com with a browser, you can see more photos. The model comes with just a single sheet of paper as the instructions. The most important thing is to not allow the rigging lines to become tangled when removing it from the box! It is tempting to pull everything out before reading the assembling instructions but be careful when doing so. The lines have small hooks on them and it is easy to tangle things up.<br /><br />Overall it is a beautiful display with it's rich, navy colored body and huge sails. It will definitely be the center of attention in whichever room you choose to display."

But the main reason it went back is because of the bottom. No sort of grip to the base so it easily slides across the counter. Quite dangerous!. I should have known by the low price that this is a piece of junk.

But the chewables are not something my dog wants to eat.  I tried grinding and mixing it with his food; his response was to stop eating his food.  The tablets are so big that they are impossible to hide and with a large dog who need 2 1/2 tablets a day, it's like a full-time job trying to figure out how to get him to eat it.  Switched to the chewables after years of trying to get the excessively large pills into him.  There has to be a way to make these so that dogs will actually want to eat them."

16621,1,Y,Video Games,B00CX8VYM0,Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag,Amazon Cruel to Children Rip Off,"Game is great... Amazon, not so much. Buyer beware that Amazon is misleading. I ordered 2 copies of this game for different people as Christmas presents. As a pre-order promotion Amazon was offering a game code that would unlock additional game content. After the order was shipped I received 2 games but only one game code. Not really paying much attention to it (my fault) I printed out the game code and attached it inside the wrapped presents not noticing that there was only one code (in spite of the fact I bought and paid for 2 games). Upon discovering this (after) the boys (2 nephews) had opened their Christmas presents I immediately felt like a heal because one game code can not be used twice; hence one gets the upgrade one does not. On Christmas day (after they boys had opened their gifts (together) the problem was immediately obvious. So, I contacted Amazon asking for help but was informed that only one code per customer could be issued no matter how many games you ordered. WTF? What kind of BS is that? Where is the logic? With this experience I want to share with everyone that if you need to order multiple copies of the same game expecting to receive the same pre-order benefits don't do it with Amazon. Order yours and have others order additional games for you if you are going to buy from Amazon; or just buy from someone else. After contacting Amazon I have been told I can send any unopened games back... Like that is even an option. Amazon customer relations and marketing needs an enema. Now I have 2 little boys disappointed on Christmas day because if I give to one I can't give to the other. This is certainly the last time I will buy games from Amazon without playing their stupid games. Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me. Big middle finger to Amazon... shame on you Amazon!"

16759,5,Y,Books,0870219618,The Sea Power of the State,Admiral Gorshkov: Russia's Mahan and Rickover?,"Sea Power of the State, written by Admiral of the Fleet Sergei G. Gorshkov and published in 1976 during his tenure as the Soviet Navy's Commander-in-Chief, provides a rarely available view into the strategic thinking which guided the development and disposition of Russian Naval forces during the 1960's and 1970's; the first time Russia possessed naval forces capable of conducting sustained operations on the world's oceans--albeit a fleet relying primarily on submarines. A considerable achievement given that when Gorshkov assumed command of the Russian Navy in 1956 it consisted primarily of vessels designed for coastal defense and was incapable of logistically supporting the ocean operation of its few capital ships or its large submarine force.  A former Naval Officer who was assigned during the aforementioned period to ships participating in an ASW (Anti-Submarine Warfare) Group which on occasion practiced the art of ASW by chasing Soviet submarines across the Pacific Ocean, as well as having personally participated as an Officer of the Deck (OOD) in sea going Soviet Navy precipitated surface confrontations, I found Gorshkov's writings interesting and most informative. ""Sea Power of the State,"" however, is not an easy read, perhaps due to translation difficulties when proceeding from Russian into English or due to the style in which Gorshkov communicated his thoughts. Further, individual points are to frequently repeated, almost to the point of nuisance. And, of course, the book is replete with ""socialist"" anti-western verbiage about the evil motivations of the aggressive imperialist nations--especially the United States. Given the Soviet Union's de facto record of Eastern Europe colonization, a reader can only wonder whether Gorskov's expressed political views actually reflect the thinking of the Soviet High Command or were just pro forma boilerplate.  ""Sea Power of the State"" is divided into several parts and opens with a 25+ page dissertation on the economic significance of ocean floor minerals, etc. giving the impression this geological survey will play a key factor underlying Gorshkov's strategic views, however, the subject area essentially (not totally) disappears from the book thereafter. It is followed by a similarly treated 30 page discussion of the importance of fishing and merchant shipping to the sea power of a state.  The next two chapters contain a 100+ page view of ""The History of [Selected] Navies"" and a 50+ page treatise on the author's views of the ""The Development of Navies after the Second World War."" These reviews and their encompassed assessments seem to provide the historical analysis on which Gorshkov based the strategic goals and objecitves he envisioned the Soviet Navy pursuing and the force formations he would configure to affect those goals.  When reviewing the American and British oceanic conflict with opposing German and Japanese fleets, Gorshkov's concentration repeatedly focuses how (he viewed) submarine warfare's influence on the war's outcome, leading him to conclude:  ""Submarines become the most important means of battle at sea. And if individual states in the pre-war period underestimated their possibilities, in the course of the war they changed their views on the use of submarine forces. .... Earlier the view was repeatedly expressed that submarines are a weapon of the weakest fleet and that strong fleets have no need of them. However, this view was flatly rebutted by the experience of the war [when] submarines of the strongest American fleet performed [the] most important role ... not only ... against Japanese shipping, but also against surface ships and submarines.""  Gorshkov, however, fails to correctly comprehend the strategically decisive role played by Aircraft Carriers and their Air Groups during World War II in the Pacific. He absurdly attributes the Japanese post-Battle of Midway retreat onto the defensive as having occurred due to the Soviet Army's victory at Stalingrad. To Gorshkov the Aircraft Carrier centric surface battles of the Pacific War could have no strategic effect because the force levels involved were so much less then were engaged in the manpower intensive (slaughters) on the Soviet / German Eastern front, perhaps demonstrating a flaw in the strategic thinking of Russian Admirals resulting from their nation's geographically necessitated concentration on large scale ground warfare. Other historical events such as the participation of Russian sailors in their country's 20th Century Civil War and the Soviet Navy's (exaggerated) contributions to the outcome of World War II are discussed in these page, but this commentary adds little to the understanding of the strategic goals Gorshkov envisioned the Soviet Navy pursuing in the post-World War II environment.  Building on this historical analysis Gorshkov concludes that ""problems associated with the art of naval warfare"" render dominance of the sea an unobtainable strategic result--as versus its possible achievement on land surfaces. His analysis underlying this conclusion is to lengthy to repeat here, but it rests on several observations and assumptions. First, Gorshkov believes that the fluid non-fixed nature of the sea precludes a naval force from firmly establishing itself in a fixed location enforcing that dominance and, second, that modern weapons systems enable fleets to extend the distance over which they could apply their [explosive] force thereby contesting any attempt at fixed dominance of a given sea area.   Clearly Russian strategic thinking did not encompass the need to establish forward bases such as those the U.S. Navy maintains around the world, probably due to the Russian military's demonstrated inability to manage substantial logistics flow over a long distance, precluding their establishing and maintaining distant bases. I personally know a number of intelligent former Russian soldiers who served in Afghanistan and asked them why the combat force the Soviet Army sent into that country was so numerically low. Their response was that their military simply lacked the logistic capabilities to sustain a force greater than 120,000 men that far from home. An acknowledgement that their nation simply lacked the management skills to logistically support a large force such as a Naval Task Group far from home, which Gorshkov must have realized.  However, despite their logistics management shortcomings, the Soviet Union did possess sufficient bright individuals with technical engineering skills and the industrial structure needed to design, produce, and staff a large number of nuclear powered submarines carrying modern weapons systems, communications capabilities, etc. needed for their Navy to maintain a large number of these vessels at sea. A technical and industrial base which Admiral Gorshkov notes necessarily underlies the development of modern navies and without which a nation cannot successfully aspire to be a sea power. Gorshkov's answer, therefore, to his problems was the deployment of a large number of nuclear powered submarines which could steam almost indefinitely at sea, restricted only by their crews need for food. A force that could target the sea communications the ""imperialist"" western industrial nations needed to support their worldwide ""aggressive"" interventions, at least in the socialist speak of the Soviet high command.  ""Sea Power of the State"" is a fascinating look into the mind of the high command of one of this nation's major military opponents. It is a rare treat and makes for a fascinating read, at least for officers of the opposing services and for anyone interested in how high level military officers view problems--especially a military officer as prominent and influential as was Admiral Gorshkov."

The reason it gets three stars instead of 4 or 5 is because although it is double breasted, there are no buttons inside the shirt to keep the front secured.  So far this has not been a problem, but I can see that with a long day's use, the inside flap may fold over inappropriately."
16824,4,Y,Home Entertainment,B00T48CVVK,Samsung UN55JU7100 55-Inch 4K Ultra HD 3D Smart LED TV,Really great TV so far,"First, I'd like to say don't pay attention to any review that isn't a verified purchase.  More than likely they're reviewing an incorrect TV or just bad mouthing Samsung.  I was checking daily for this TV to show up on Amazon.  I did so because I was holding out for the new Samsung TV line to come out.  I bought this set on 3/6/15, the day it came out. There was immediately a review shortly thereafter from someone which I knew it was complete BS. That review claimed that the TV arrived with dust on it and spelled &#34;welcome&#34; incorrectly and all these problems of clouding blah blah blah.  It wasn't true in the least. I'm telling ya, don't consider any review that isn't a verified purchase.  This TV is really great so far.  I got this specific model because it was literally the only new Samsung TV that wasn't curved.  I wasn't sold on curved after doing a ton of reviewing about it and checking it out in the store. Purchased on 3/6 and it got here about 3/10..  The packing was really well.  You'll need basic tools to put the cable detangler/stand on.  I was able to do it myself.  Unlike the other reviews, I had no problem connecting to Wifi.  I did start wireless at first no problems, but now have it connected to an Apple Airport Extreme that I use as an accesspoint to hardwire both my TV and my PS4(for the purpose of faster download/upload speed of course).  My TV did update immediately upon purchase and I found it updating within the first couple of days often (probably due to new release, getting bugs out)  The video is great.  I haven't tested 4k via netflix or the sort yet, but have been playing games on the PS4 and streaming video from my Apple Macbook Pro over to the Panasonic.  What I wasn't a fan of at first, but now like is the One Connect Mini.  The TV is otherwise naked as far as connecting ports without it(no hdmi on the TV directly itself).  I have come to like it because one of the problems I've had in my other TVs is that the HDMI cable had a hardtime staying connected into the port when it was horizontally hanging from the middle/upper corner of the TV.  The cable would eventually just get loose, droop downward giving it a weak connection.  The one connect mini fixes that, but it still seems odd the TV doesn't have at least ONE HDMI port directly on it, in case ya know, something happens to the One Connect Mini.  This is why it doesn't get 5 stars.  You shouldn't need box that is like an accessory for a TV.   Also I noticed that the One Connect Mini isn't universal among all points.  Like I can't plug my PS4 or computer into one of the ports at one side etc.   I am about to pick up a Roku 3 or Apple TV to stream video over wirelessly.  The remote is pretty cool and accessing the menu options etc is a piece of cake.  The remote is motion sensitive and is your primary way of guiding through the TV(though the power button the back will allow you to toggle through as well).  I have this in my room and doesn't experience any clouding.  Granted in the sun, I can see reflections such as blinds etc, but overall I really am happy with the purchase."
16826,5,Y,Beauty,B009LH3KPU,"Purely Pro Cosmetics Brow Blender, Pencil Dark Taupe, 0.002 Ounce",Great brows with this pencil,Previously I had to buy this brow pencil from a make-up artist. I'm so glad Amazon carries it. This pencil is soft and a bit powder-y so it applies for a natural look.  Many brow pencils are too waxy; this one isn't.  I buy dark taupe and soft taupe and blend them.  I use this product every day to fill in and extend my brow line. I've tried many brow pencils but this is the best.

They were well acted and thought out, and they brought the movie that much closer to the book.  I can't say enough about the extra 22 minutes.<br /><br />One thing almost killed the whole movie for me...THE MUSIC!!!  It turned the movie's scenes that were supposed to be filled with tension and drama into this cheesy 60's movie.  Scenes, like the park scene and the sunset scene, didn't need the loud, obnoxious music blaring in the background.  It was unnecessary and distracting.  I'm currently unsure about how I feel for the movie as a whole.  I keep thinking back to the original and the scenes that were added by themselves and I'm happy.  Then, I try to watch the complete novel version and I have to grit my teeth and wince during some of my favorite parts."

I'm one of those guys that has the fortune of a small wrist and havevto be careful about the size of the display. Otherwise it will look quite odd on my wrist. This watch sits perfectly and is thinner thannit seems in the picture. Good for me, but if you're one that enjoys a thicker display this may not fit your taste. The band is perfect for a sport watch. Very flexible with two fastens with a matetial that does not feel like it will rip.<br /><br />Thevreason for the four stars and not five is only due to the fact itvis called a sport watch, but does not have a lot of &#34;bells-n-whistles&#34; many sport watches do. I would more put this watch lower fashion watch with a sport type band. The smaller functions, day and month turners, work just fine.

Got it, and although the packaging is beautiful, and it will fit in my purse nicely, I found the scent to be VERY strong, overpowering, and frankly... like something an old woman might wear.  What's worse, I couldn't wash it off!!!  Even after 5 or 6 sessions scrubbing with hot soapy water, I STILL couldn't rid myself of that smell!  Turns out my niece didn't like it either. Sigh.  I see plenty of great reviews on other sites, so obviously others like it a great deal.  My advice is to try it somewhere first before buying.  Wish I'd done that myself!  Good Luck!"

17092,5,Y,Health & Personal Care,B0095PZHPE,"Fitbit One Wireless Activity Plus Sleep Tracker, Black",Skeptic turned Super Fan!,"Previous Jawbone Up user here. I am someone who doesn't go to the gym to work out because of my schedule. Everyday I'm running to/from classes, work, meetings, etc. I like that a fitness device can track how many steps I've taken in a day and how many miles I've traveled throughout the day.<br /><br />I went back and forth for nearly two weeks trying to decide between the Fitbit One and the Fitbit Zip. I liked that the Zip was cheaper and did the basic functions (pedometer, distance) that I needed. I also liked that it was smaller. Yet I went with the One because I am actually interested in the sleep tracking function.<br /><br />I read many reviews and surfed through countless forums/debates on which device was better and why people liked one or the other more. Based on reviews from other women, I was worried that the Fitbit One would be more uncomfortable and inconvenient to wear simply because it's a little bit larger than the Fitbit Zip. I've had the One for nearly a month now and I absolutely LOVE the size of it. It clips perfectly on the fabric in between my bra (regular bra, not a sports bra). I face the LCD screen towards my chest and the clip faces front. I choose to do that just because I'm paranoid and feel like the actual device is more secure this way. Also, the battery life of the One is great! I can go two weeks until I need to charge it again.<br /><br />Why did I return the Jawbone Up band and stick with Fitbit One? Funny you ask! I actually loved the design of the Up band but I hated that I had to plug it into my phone every time I wanted to sync my data. I also wear a watch everyday on my non-dominant hand and I didn't like wearing too much on my wrist.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend the Fitbit One to anyone! I also LOVE that the MyFitnessPal app syncs with the Fitbit app! Kudos to you Fitbit, you guys know what you're doing...and you're doing it right."

Still, they are so soft and warm that I love them and keep them by my side at night. Perfect for cold weather! I think it's better that they are a bit too large for me though, because I hate tight slippers if they push on the tips of my toes. I wish I could figure out the right way to order the perfect size, but I think one size smaller would be too tight for me. That's MY fault though because one of my feet is size 7 and one is size 6 and 1/2. So, one foot would always be too loose and one would be too tight."

The final cards look nice, but the slight roughness on the edges still reveals that these are self printed cards.<br /><br />With professionally printed cards being very inexpensive (even from Avery), the only reason to use these would be if you need a small batch, frequently change the information, or want a way to print cards in an emergency."

It's cheap which allows you to not spend alot of money on your first guitar only to lose interest or quit. But I do not recommend this guitar to any seasoned guitar player. It goes out of tune very quickly. Alothough it does produce a warm tone, I just can't handle the constant tuning."

When the headlights hit the Pedicab's reflective film it's does the job well by reflecting the light. When you unrolling the sheet from the roll it does have some wrinkles, I believe that is quite normal when it is rolled on a roll and then unrolled. It  can be corrected by pilling the plastic sheet from the role and then applying back onto the sheet and smoothing out the bubbles in the process. This reflective film usually is really expensive. The small hassle of having to reapply some parts of the wrinkled sheets is a small price to pay for the incredible price you pay for the reflective room. It looks good on my pedicabs in Houston.

I really like the style, look and feel of it. It keeps great time and is waterproof (a must for me because I wear it 24/7 in the shower and pool). The complaint I have is that the chronographs' pushers stick in a very short time (1 week) which makes it quite difficult to start or stop and essentially useless. My first watch has the same issue.<br />I cut Invicta some slack figuring this was an anomaly and went ahead to puchase the second watch. Buyer beware!<br />I think of Invicta as a quality watch company but they've really dropped the ball on this one and hence the 1 Star rating I'm giving it.<br />If you are purchasing this watch to actually use the chronograph think again. If that function isn't important to you go ahead and buy it because it is otherwise a great watch."

The only negative is that it seems to tip over easy, & the clip on holder for one of the extra pieces snapped off when this happened.

EASIER TO KEEP A PLACE CLEAN IF THE VACUUM IS NIFTY AND ACCESSIBLE LIKE THIS. (PROBABLY WON'T WORK FOR CARS THOUGH, AS HEAD UNIT IS TOO BIG AND YOU MAY NEED MORE SUCTION.)<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />UPDATE: AFTER SIX WEEKS, THE MOTORIZED HEAD UNIT STOPPED WORKING PROPERLY. INTERMITTENT ON/OFF. INFURIATING.<br /><br />DYSON SENT ME A REPLACEMENT HEAD UNIT: IT DIDN'T WORK EITHER. THEN THEY REPLACED THE WHOLE MACHINE. IT HAS BEEN WORKING SO FAR.

THERE HAVE BEEN COMPLAINTS ON THE WEB ABOUT THIS.<br /><br />THE WARRANTY AT LEAST IS GOOD. i RATED IT A 4 BEFORE THE REPAIR ISSUES; NOW JUST A 2 BECAUSE IT BROKE DOWN SO FAST. iF YOU ARE GOING TO PAY BIG BUCKS, YOU JUST SIMPLY CANNOT HAVE A PRODUCT THAT BREAKS DOWN SOON.<br />------------------------------------------<br /><br />This works for me. Besides it's fun using it; I almost look forward to vacuuming.<br /><br />I'm in a one-bedroom apt. and before this have never been able to keep up with a cat dragging kitty litter grit across the floor and on the carpet. Now I have the big equalizer!<br /><br />Well balanced and easy to move: the weight of the battery is just below the butt of your hand. Smartly placed. Head unit rotates superbly (90 degrees along a floorboard). Dyson has thought carefully about this and delivers.<br /><br />First impression on powering up was that it's a toy. BUT that is NOT the case. Sucks up a surprising amount of cat hair from carpet. If you put down baking soda, it will vacuum it all up again. Astonishing. Brush unit seems very efficient, EVEN if it does not feel powerful. It works, period.<br /><br />Never run out of power, even at high power, set to last 6 mins. But that's in a one-bedroom apt.<br /><br />Nice and quiet. No irritating, high-pitched whine. This is not a jet engine like some handheld vacs.<br /><br />In short, perfect for an apt., kitchen floors and doorways, but not a house or deep shag carpets or a car."

I actually had a hard time trying to remove it (to see if I could, in case I wanted to change the case).  I was a bit unprepared for the weight it added to the notebook, though. I got a MacBook Air because it's very light and after putting on the case, it became heavy. After about a day though, I got used to it.

However, neither problem has occurred (so far after one month). Only problem is that sometimes I need to pull the cover taut if I notice it starts to bunch up in the middle as I crank it up. Otherwise, it makes a world of difference covering/uncovering as compared to dealing with a cover without a reel. It's smooth enough that my wife and children can work on their own. According to the reps at the local pool store, pool water needs to be exposed to air several hours a day and this reels makes that chore a lot more tolerable."

I originally had a bit of reservation about the quality of the wheel (for not having seen and felt it), but now that I have used it for over three months, everything is holding up like a Samsonite should do!  And the wheels are a life saver too considering the total weight of around 25lbs between the bag itself and all of the contents on my average day, that I can roll around instead of wearing it on my shoulder.<br /><br />Highly recommend this to anyone who have a need to lug around a heavy lap top and some ...."

It does take a tuner while in use so if you have four tuners like me, you can only use three on the tivo while watching live TV on a mini. It does release the tuner when not using it.

Once you try a daylight bulb, you may never go back  to the yellow incandescent light again. Compact florescent lights also are made in daylight versions.

17559,4,Y,Baby,B00IANUYSC,"Infantino Fusion Flexible Position Baby Carrier, Grey",Love the versatility,"This carrier has been great. There are three main things I love about it.<br /><br />1. It was a waist belt. A lot of carriers that can have the baby front facing only have the shoulder straps. Those kill your back after a while. I can hold my 20 pound baby for quite a while with no back pain.<br /><br />2. It's really easy to adjust. My husband and I both use this product quite often. My husband is about 8 in. taller than me, so this is a must for us. Not only is it easy to adjust, it's pretty quick too.<br /><br />3. There are several carrying positions. There are 4 to be exact. Facing you narrow seat, facing you wide seat, facing out, and backpack. The facing you narrow seat is great when the baby is too small to wrap their legs around you. This is a problem with most ergonomic baby carriers. Then when the baby is big enough, you can use the facing you wide seat, which is the safest position for babies in carriers-especially for longer periods of time. Facing out is great when baby can hold their head up and want to explore. I haven't used the backpack carry yet, but I imagine that will be very helpful as my baby grows.<br /><br />There's only one drawback in this carrier. It's hard to change from the wide seat to the narrow seat. It's very hard to get the toggles and buttons through the holes. This may just be to keep the carrier more secure though, so it may be a good thing.<br /><br />It's a great carrier. I'd recommend it to anyone."

17612,1,N,Video Games,B00CX6XKK6,Call of Duty: Ghosts - Xbox One,I'm dissapointed,"I've played the game for 3 months now, and overall I'm just disappointed. The only reason to play this game; it clearly has a large base of players for online multiplayer - including my family and friends. The negatives far outweigh that, however:<br /><br />1st Player Gameplay<br />The story - as always for COD - is terrible. It's a hodge-podge of random events that happen for a string of characters that I have a hard enough time telling apart, let alone feeling emotion for. No redeeming value here.<br /><br />Multiplayer<br />The multiplayer is very disorganized; most notably in how it ranks players. Unlike other games, any give player is placed in a game with both beginners, and expert players. The game refuses to rank games by skill, and the disparity of player ability is unbelievably frustrating.<br /><br />Visual<br />Teams, opponents, scenery... it all looks the same. Granted, I am moderately color blind, but you can't tell you teammates from your foes until the &#34;gamertag&#34; floats above their body. The problem is, that notification above each player is both very difficult to differentiate, and very inconsistent in appearance (if someone runs around an object it often doesn't appear until they are well into the room).<br /><br />System<br />Again, I've been playing for 3 months, however, each time I try to play with my friends (of which we have a group of about 6) we struggle to even get everyone in the same game. The UX is absolutely terrible. We cannot send game invites, we cannot setup parties, and we cannot communicate even after inviting all to a group. It's like the UX was designed by a toddler, I don't know how this passed QA."

I was pleasantly surprised with this set! Yes, it is polyester, but does not feel or breath like it. The top of the duvet is rich and satiny, and not in that shiny, cheap, scratchy way. The underside has almost a sueded feel,  moves well with the sheet and is very soft to the touch. If I was pressured, I might say that the fabric was a little thin, but with a hefty down comforter inside, it is quite warm and seems much more expensive than what I paid. The throws are also equally high quality, though one arrived a bit lumpy. The pattern is GORGEOUS, and I felt that the picture was very accurate in color.

17645,5,Y,Luggage,B005UNECNS,Maxwell Scott Luxury Black Leather Bag Strap - One Size,I highly recommend this very dependable strap and the excellent service of this country.,"I highly recommend this item. The price on this may have gone up some, I bought one some time ago. This is a VERY GOOD strap. One of the frequent problems with such items is that the metal is often a very low quality, planned obsolescence type of metal that I believe is called &#34;pot metal&#34;, almost something like metal manufacturing leftover scrap materials, and the mechanism when a strap is made of that will tend to bend out of shape or break, or bend out of shape and then break when you bend it back.<br /><br />I bought this strap back more than a year and a half ago. I am kind of rough as far as loading a bag up a lot and was using the strap to often walk four miles a day to a bus plus sometimes hanging groceries off the bag on the way back. What I say then is not typical entirely typical use But the strap lasted and lasted and lasted in spite of my putting great strain on it. It lasted a lot longer than any strap I had ever had, perhaps about a year and a half or more, when straps usually gave out on me in, perhaps, two months. One day it broke. I had overpacked my bag and then had additional materials hanging from it.<br /><br />This may sound silly, but I actually felt saddened, because I had been able to depend upon this strap like no other.<br /><br />Then the thought occurred to me to check on whether there was a guarantee. There was, and although I had to mail the strap in to them, they promptly, courteously, without question or grumbling fixed it.<br /><br />If you are an actor or actress in a movie and pretending to carry something for a scene, you will not need this strap. But if you have to depend on a strap to carry a bit of weight and you need for it to last, I highly recommend this strap.<br /><br />And if you ARE an actor or actress in a movie and pretending to carry something for a scene, try to get the producer to supply you with this strap with the stipulation that you will be allowed to take it home."

The mounting plate covers the connection areas for my TV, maybe just mine, or my brand but I had to cut and hack to get it to work and the latching mechanism that is supposed to hold it up is weak at best and I keep having to tighten it, I think mine has a weak spring that keeps compressing more and more.  It also sort of hold the TV perpendicular for viewing, but the friction mechanism that is supposed to counteract the weight of the tv when viewing is also weak and it ends up inching itself back about 5 degrees.<br /><br />But for under $15, I feel bad complaining.

17709,5,Y,Video Games,B00AAQRNQ8,"Anker 8200 DPI High Precision Programmable Laser Gaming Mouse for PC, 9 Programmable Buttons, Weight Tuning Cartridges, Omron Micro",Pretty sweet gaming mouse for a sweet price.,"This mouse is great. It is plug and play, you don't need the software if you want a minimal installation. It does help because it maps the buttons. I am ""upgrading"" from a Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000 and this mouse is just as big. It fits the palm very well, just the tips of the pinkie finger and ring finger rubs on the mouse pad. I have yet used it from FPS gaming but it does well on Darksiders and League of Legends. It has a very nice build, the only flaw is that the buttons that rest on the thumb isn't as flush as the rest of the mouse, a very small amount of play is there but it isn't the only thing wrong with it. I believe it is made from the USA so thats a plus if you want to ""buy American"" as this is a quality product. One other tick is that the Anchor is the only thing that could change in the light color, not the scroll wheel or those three lights near the index finger. To me it isn't much as a big deal, just slightly misleading as I thought those would also be color changing too.<br /><br />Compared to the M$ mouse I used it is considerably lighter, something I thought would change when I put all the weights, but it that one is still pretty heavy.<br />For the price this thing is amazing, this review is only within the month I had bought it but it is lovely."

17714,5,N,Sports,B0002IL7R0,Columbia River - Lake Signature Combo Edge w/ leather fob,CRKT 7113 Lake Signature Knife Review,"CRKT makes okay knives,they come sharp and function and that's all some people are after but as far as the Lake Signature? definitely their finest knife(in my opinion).In short this knife is one of those models to seek out among the pile of modern knives,made in 2001/2002.So let's get to the knife...<br /><br />Aluminum/Zytel Construction:<br />Altogether I'm not a stickler for weight on a modern knife,especially if it's made with metallic alloys but some people are.For a aluminum bodied knife it's got the most heft versus something like a Gerber AR 3.0 or the Gerber Air Ranger,I actually like that reminds me how solid this knife is.The zytel inlay is just for texture because hand perspiration makes a metal alloyed knife slippery,can't say much for it other than it helps and it hasn't came out.There is a half-length zytel backspacer to substitute the typical two pillar construction,I believe over the years they have changed to pillar design but Michael Walker designs used to possess this backspacer approach.<br /><br />Blade Access/LAWKS Design:<br />Like your common Taiwan made knife the washers are Teflon,personally I think they're as good as bronze...smooth opening.The actual blade access is very unusual because thumb-studs aren't used and this design won't replace them,but it's a cool and effective approach by CRKT.The Design is a milled out nail-nick with machining work above it at the blade spine,I guess they went with the handle shape thumb studs weren't possible with the design.Some people ask the question 'why bother make a liner lock with a safety switch'?a very good question.Liner locks vary a lot in reliability,mostly if they are thick or thin, or if their perfectly centered under the blade.With a traditional liner lock a big no no is punching holes with it using force,maybe not the first time you do it will the lock fail and it will happen eventually.The LAWKS design is a steel secondary washer beside the blade with a tab and when you activate it that tab leans forward and goes behind the liner lock while deployed.Now I wouldn't praise the LAWKS design by Michael Walker so highly to say it will replace lockbacks and fixed blades on a permanent basis,but it will blow away the common liner lock as it's intended for hard use.On the Lake Signature you slide the pocket clip to angled position to engage the LAWKS system,slide the clip to straight position to disengage.The function isn't like turning a bolt it's a smooth click action.The pocket clip design of this secondary lock CRKT went for a more stealthy/tactical approach,they pulled it off nicely and I haven't damaged my pocket clip but I'd rather it be the common Walker design,a push/pull lever.<br /><br />Clip-Point Blade/AUS-8 Japanese Stainless Steel:<br />It's a good looking clip-point,came very sharp with a attractive satin finish and well designed serrations,not Spyderco or original Lone Wolf quality but I'd rate them a 7.5 out of 10.The blade has 3-1/4"" cutting edge with some swedgework and a hollow grind,makes a good small game knife.The AUS-8 I've got to give props to Taiwan for using on their knives,japanese steels are well designed for an actual knife user and for some reason I've seen better performance on knives overseas than I have on American made knives.Not much I can dive into about AUS-8 other that it holds a pretty good edge yet it's just soft enough to sharpen on a stone,pretty low maintenance steel since it's smooth sharpening.These days AUS-8 is more common to come across but ten to twelve years ago? it made 440A look like garbage.Aside from this steel there were some really good japanese steels out there like ATS-34 and ATS-55,those are pretty rare on knives as VG-10 replaced them currently but they were premium steels.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br />Overall the fit and finish was excellent and I really liked the knife and I highly recommend the 7113 Lake Signature model by CRKT.This is the only knife I ever bought by CRKT,not all their knives are junk but there's a few reasons why this knife costs more than a typical CRKT knife...<br /><br />-It's a rare knife by CRKT,discontinued about ten years ago<br /><br />-It was a fourty dollar knife as a more premium/high quality offering by CRKT.It's a little outdated looking versus their newer knives but it's still a great knife!<br /><br />5-stars!"

However, it does have some drawbacks.  First, anytime you hook up your phone (i have an iPhone) and you want to play the iPod, the unit will always start playing the first song in the alphabet.  Even if you turn your car off take the phone and come back to the car to start playing where you left off, it will again start at the first song in the alphabet.  That part annoys me.  Next the microphone for the bluetooth is not that great.  People have a hard time hearing me, and I like to do voice to text when I am driving.  With the bluetooth, it has no idea what I am saying, and therefore, has kinda made that feature useless.  The last issue I have, which may not be a big issue to some, is that when you turn the unit off, the LCD screen stays on.  It will say that it is off, but it is still lit up with the animation still going.  I also think that the apps that are useable by this head unit are too limited.  I only use one of the apps that it is compatible for.  They need to do some upgrading on that."

Lose your connection, be it your fault or theirs and you lose all progress.  Just today I had an issue after bulldozing a buidling which caused a pop up to say the game was no longer working correctly.  To correct the issue my choices offered by the game were:<br />1.

We bought two at a Macy's a year ago, and we loved them so much we bought several of these sets of four for ourselves and gifts. They are excellent for saving a half-finished bottle and do not leak.  We use them to cork the bottle and then put the bottle back in the wine refrigerator.  The wine stays in great condition and we've never had any problems with the wine later, unlike many of the fancy or pretty stoppers we've had and purchased in the past.  The colors are cheerful and make them easy to locate in your kitchen. I highly recommend these stoppers."

I purchased these after those that came with my mountain bike deteriorated. I was pleased to see that these grips were twice as thick. This not only provides for longer wear it also makes them extremely comfortable. When I ride it is always over ten miles and these grips give me more support and control than those for a much higher price. If you make sure the size is correct for your bike these should not disappoint. By-the-way 90mm is roughly 3 1/2 inches.

I was hoping for a strong coffee flavour to help me keep energized and focused in the mornings. The shake lacks that coffee flavour i wanted, and is just way too sweet to drink. The shake also has that chalky texture, but not flavour as you can't taste anything over the sweetness. For me, the nutritional benefits just cant outweigh the taste. Perhaps if they lowered the sweetness and upped the coffee flavour, I'd give it another go."

Then none of the arms are actually level so the lamp shades were all catawampus. We tried to right all the arms to level the top of the shades but it was like chasing cats.

I had a bicycle headlight; but apparently, the driver didn‚Äôt see me.<br />I was pretty banged up‚Äîbut thankfully, I was able to walk away from the crash. My bike sustained serious damage, I was bleeding, but all x-rays were negative. Whew.<br />Among the ‚Äúcasualties‚Äù was my bicycle headlight. The driver agreed to replace it.<br />She meant to give me $20 for a new one. I think she mistakenly gave me $40. I called her to return the money to her. She felt badly about the whole thing, and didn‚Äôt really want to come back for the money. She also was pretty sure she gave me the correct amount.<br />I proposed a compromise: I said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you what; I‚Äôll use the extra $$$ to purchase a better headlight; that way, ‚Äúnext time‚Äù we can proactively attempt to prevent a recurrence of this type of accident.<br />She loved the idea.<br />So, with $40 to spend, and now looking for a top-quality headlight, I found your product‚Äîfor $39.97! ( I warned the driver that I may be a little off from my $40 price, LOL)<br />I am so far very happy with both my purchase and your friendly and professional customer service!<br />One last story: The other night, I was biking late at night.

However, I wish the stickers were of a higher quality (a little thicker).  I found that they wrinkled very easily.  Since my baby likes to move so much, I have to get the picture taken right away or the sticker doesn't look so great.  If you want to attempt to use on a couple of different outfits or you find that your little one isn't into having his/her picture taken and you want to postpone the photo-shoot... the sticker may get fold marks.  This is totally fine, but a vinyl sticker would really be better for these purposes.  For the price, I certainly was expecting something a little more robust."

My only complaint is that the face of the watch is plastic, making it incredibly easy to scratch. It would have been a little better if the face had been recessed just slightly so that the outer edge of the rim would offer some protection.

18020,3,Y,Office Products,B001BLNU68,Bellino Wheeled Computer Office Porter - Black,excellent for my line of work - telescoping handle only lasted one year.,"This bag has proved to be excellent for my line of work. I take books and games to socialize 1-on-1 with people who have dementia.  It's large enough to hold lots of books etc. and wide enough to hold my 17"" laptop (in the regular compartment, not the built-in computer pocket which was made for a 15"")  I folded and put a padded manilla envelope to line the bottom of the case so it will pad my computer on the bottom, and make it easier to find things in the black interior.  It has an expand-out pocket on one outside end(perfect for keys, name badges, cell phone)and a zip open front pocket for office supplies (my scissors, pens, craft paper cutters).  The handle and wheels work well and the extra velcro strap that holds top open is WONDERFUL so top is not continually folding closed on you when you want to take things in and out.<br /><br />I should say I do not plan on flying with this bag (that is to say my work does not require that I fly) - it's strictly a way for me to transport items to and from my home to car to client's house. It feels sturdy and secure, but I will not have the occasion to put if in checked luggage of airlines - that's a whole other world.<br /><br />But I will attest it is well made, zippers work well, it's conveniently laid out, and I'm very happy with it considering the low price and the many convenient built in extras. I do load it with books and that's a really heavy load, and it performs great.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/10/13  Well, it lasted almost exactly one year.  Everything about the bag is like new, and I use it 5 days a week, so I am impressed with the overall quality of the bag.  BUT the telescoping handle suddenly decided it does not want to work. Without a working telescoping the handle it's not of much value to me (I don't fancy picking it up and carrying it when the handle refuses to extend)  So I'm reducing my rating to 3 stars. It's a pity, it's a great bag, it's that damned handle.........."

When I was shopping for a 40', I needed a composite input on it to play some oldschool videogames and what not. After a good hour or two of tinkering with the video settings (the defaults aren't the greatest and is why it loses a star), the picture is as good as can be with no significant lagging or whatever. There is also a game mode if you want one, although I personally just stick with the settings I set up for it. Overall great TV if you need that composite input, otherwise, go for something else cause you might save a buck."

18071,5,N,Lawn and Garden,B00304KOW2,"Skeeter Screen 90200 Personal Mosquito Deterrent, 4-Ounce",Read other reviews but...works great for us,"My son and I are mosquito magnets.  We live in the DFW area....not sure if that matters, but I haven't been bit even once while wearing this stuff.  We ran out and I ran to CVS and bought a bottle of OFF that does not contain DEET...some other chemical that has a multitude of warnings on it...and I was swarmed the instant I went outside.  I am going back to Skeeter Screen.<br /><br />On another note...for those bothered by mosquitoes...they do not like yarrow.  I don't know how they react to the ornamental type, but I know they stay away from the wild stuff.  I lived in a tent in Colorado for two years and with the spring thaw...mosquitoes in swarms too big to believe would be on the hunt.  I remember reading about yarrow of which there was plenty growing wild up there and started picking the flower heads and putting them in my button holes.  The swarm would follow in a cloud a couple feet from my head, but wouldn't come closer.  They never bit.  It isn't smelly stuff so I am not sure why they avoid it, but they do.  I am planning on planting some yarrow in my garden for next year."

18088,5,Y,Outdoors,B000FGYKWS,Delta Cycle Alloy Bicycle Stem Raiser,World of Difference,"I installed the Delta stem riser on my 2013 Motobecane Fantom 29er COMP. Before I did, I asked bike shop personnel about changing cables. One guy said that with a stem riser, 90% of bikes require cable replacement. I was reluctant to pay to have it done. Also I was reluctant to replace the cables on my own; never tried, nor did I want to on my brand new $700 bike. But I bought it anyway. I decided to install it and then figure out the cable issue. When I did, there was no cable issue. Even at the highest position, the handlebar turned fine. All the cables still had slack. I beat all the odds. Ever since my riding has become much more comfortable. I can sit upright much easier, with less strain on my back and neck. For those mountain bikers that do more back or open road riding than switchbacks, it definitely improves the quality of the ride. I would buy it any day. Lastly, installation was quick and simple."

I strung it on off-white hemp string with various carved bone beads to match, as well as small golden beads and tiny amber beads ranging from dark brown to orange to cream.  The point was to complement and showcase the beautiful pendant, which I received as a gift.  I am impressed with the intricacy of the carvings; the back and sides of the pendant are as lovely as the front, and it is delightful to hold.  It is definitely worth more than twenty dollars."

18123,5,N,Beauty,B007JD51QY,Hard Candy TAKE IT OFF,GREAT PRODUCT FOR REMOVING MAKE UP AND STAY-PUT LIPSTICK,"I bought this at a local mart store for under six bucks. It's a nice sized bottle of make up remover and really does take off make up that other removers leave behind.  I only use the ""stay-put paint-on"" type of lipstick that doesn't wash off with normal soap, cold cream, baby oil or vaseline.  This does take it right off, though.  It's also great at taking off waterproof mascara and ""stay-put"" foundation.  For the size of the bottle, it's a real bargain compared to the little bottles of remover that I've bought in the past to remove my lipstick for the same price or higher.  I will definitely buy it again when I run out."

The white one was covered with grey smudges, some of which I was able to get off, but not all.  The blue one had white letters that were covered with lint and dirt as well, but came clean when washed.

The main compartment is a little too small for a jacket and the side pockets won't hold much more than a tube and lever.  Some might find their legs hit the bag as it is a bit wide and mounts down the seat tube.  All that said, I really like the bag and would definitely buy again if only limited storage is needed."

18210,4,N,Sports,B008VILMIW,SKLZ Ball First Trainer - Golf Ball Striking Trainer,Good ball-striking trainer mat for proper techniques.,"Being a weekend recreational golfer, I'm always on the lookout for training tools to improve my game.  This Sklz Ball-First Trainer/Ball Striking Mat looked promising.<br /><br />Likes:<br />>The purpose of this training mat is to train proper ball striking techniques, specifically a proper lag, a downward strike, and a square clubface at impact.<br />>Made of a high visibility, flexible, and hefty material that's easily rolled up and stored into a golf bag.<br />>This J-shaped mat has holes near the four corners for placing golf tees to stabilize the mat.<br />>Clear visual club path guides which are at a very slight angle to the arrow/intended path of trajectory.<br />>Markers enable analysis of proper downward strike by looking at the divots created past the ball position line or impact point.  However, divots (dirt scooped up by the swing) made would only be visible on grass, not on artificial turf at some driving ranges.<br /><br />Slight Concern:<br />Initially, I was hitting this mat all over the place but the goal here is proper form, control, and swing path.  Gradually, the mat moved less, meaning my swing has improved.  My brother laughed at me for being such a precise, technical geek.<br /><br />How has the training mat worked so far?<br />I have used it during a practice round of golf with more experienced family members.  The mat has helped me line up properly and hit the ball squarely with the clubface with improved consistency and accuracy.  It not going to transform recreational golfers into pros overnight but does provide basic guidance for proper positioning relative to the ball for more consistent strikes and accuracy.  This mat will not replace an experienced golf pro instructor but will provide fundamental ball striking techniques training for most beginners and amateur golfers."
18221,5,Y,Wireless,B00IZ1VNZ2,"HTC One M8, Gunmetal Grey 32GB (AT&T)",Superior to its competitors,"I will review the hardware more than the software, considering this is an android phone.<br /><br />I took this phone up against its biggest competitors, namely the Samsung Galaxy S5 and the LG G3.  Both of these claim to have superior screens and cameras.  It is true that both have cameras with greater megapixels - but a million megapixel camera on a 1mm screen is still going to receive insufficient levels of light to make a halfway decent photograph.  I took pictures with all three and realized very quickly that the HTC One, with its 5 megapixel dual camera, produced higher quality photographs than the others.<br /><br />Then I tested their screens.  It wasn't a hard sell.  I popped up several videos from different sources (youtube, vimeo, amazon) and played them on all three.  The LG and Samsung phones had surprisingly grainy screens, while the HTC One screen was quite clear.<br /><br />The HTC One is also good on size.  I do not have to strain to see anything or use the screen.  The speakers were slightly better quality than the LG and Samsung.  The battery also lasts a very long time, especially when I change it to Energy Saver mode, which makes it so it doesn't vibrate every time I type something into it.<br /><br />All in all, I find that the HTC One m8 is a better smartphone."

The shoe has a bigger profile than a typical mary janes and doesn't &#34;dress up&#34; as well. So, I would advise that this shoe is not suitable as a dress up shoe."

I don't have time to play real D&D any more, the days on having 8 hours free on the weekend are long gone. But this is a nice alternative. It is basically D&D, but the player characters are set in advance. You don't have to look up stuff in guides, because info about armor class and damage and spells and such, are all on the playing cards. Nobody has to play the role of Dungeon Master, because the encounter/instructions tell you what all the monsters do, who they go after, etc. It is also random each time, because the way you place the board tiles and draw cards, it makes it different. There are a zillion parts/pieces, so I recommend you get a little case with subdividers to hold everything, or else get a bunch of ziplock bags."

This one ups the ante with the addition of a strobe mode and a wider headband although the tilt mechanism seems to be a bit more unwilling. This could turn out to be an asset. The old one could last for 40+ hours using a combination of spot and red light modes. It's ability to pivot proved immeasurable when I adorned my house with 10,000+ Christmas mini-lights.

Did NOT enjoy at all.  I do like the ease of simple ingredients you add when making & they are quick & easy to mix.  They did NOT raise much in the pan either.  It's wonderful that one bag makes TWO 8x8&#34; pans.  Fortunately, I only made one 8x8&#34; pan the first (& only) time I've made.  Next time I will try to figure out how much sugar to add for the half bag quantity of batter, & hope it tastes much better.  I tried sprinkling with powdered sugar to help sweeten it, but that just did NOT cut that bitter taste at all.  If anyone has experimented with this, please email me & let me know what you think!  Unfortunately, I ordered the 6 bag quantity from Amazon in order to get the best price.  Unwisely, I had never tried these before I purchased this large quantity (which I have never done before) but regrettably went by the many 5-star reviews.

After screwing around for about 30 minutes I changed the cable and I was in business!! Yes I keep one around just for that reason..<br /><br />Network set up on my wired network was automatic and did not require me to intervene. It looks as though a static address could be set if it was desired.<br /><br />I spent some time playing with set up so I was familiar with the menu flow. Then streamed a movie from Amazon Prime!!<br /><br />This should be a sweet device!! It downloads the control codes for your cable box, satellite dish and television and many other devices and gives control of them all. I installed and configured an app to view my networked security cameras. Keyboard, mouse, web browser and Android apps. Keyboard controls for most of the necessary functions of attached devices.<br /><br />I'll update the review if there are any problems longer term.<br />2013_02_27<br /><br />Long term downloading became a problem and playing streaming videos got to be tough. The ""aw snap"" the """" plugin has encountered a problem is WAY TO COMMON. On top of that I believe it was already obsolete when I bought it. No updating of the OS seems to happen. The plug in crash is a known problem and I have been able to make none of the work arounds happen. The fan grinds along 24/7 and is becoming loud enough to be ""very"" annoying.<br /><br />2013_05_20<br /><br />Ok so I have finally tired of the constant crashes of the plugins for streaming video from Amazon. After the latest update the video from Amazon would not stream at all. Since I'm a Prime member that would be really nice to have. Looks like an ongoing problem between Flash and Chrome. Who knows.. Pulled the top off and blew out the fan to no avail.<br /><br />I bought a ROKU and it's working out of the box. No hassle, no crashing, nofan."

It is difficult to find 100% compatible mounting plates. According to some info provided by reviewers, I bought two extra &#34;Arca-swiss&#34; plates on Amazon. They cannot fit in unless I manually remove the latch pin on the tripod. That way the new plates can fit, but it leaves the camera unsecured."

I would struggle for sometimes 20-30 min with my old box Laser to set it perfect. This one is right away, first try.<br /><br />Cons, the 3¬∞ (5¬∞?) self leveling range is very small. it really wants that bubble night on the middle. you really have to adjust the little tripod legs every time. Pro, the legs adjust well, smoothly and fast. Easy to get good at. the beeping when your trying to set it up is somewhat loud and angry.<br /><br />Con 2, the gap at the bottom, between the down point and the beginning of the line is bigger then I hoped. 2-3 ft.

I have always found them so hard to apply and find that after the application, I usually have air pockets, or didn't align in correctly.  Tech Armor has put those worries to rest!  I opened the package to find that the directions were clear and very easy to follow.  Still, I decided to go to YouTube to watch a video of how to apply it, which made the process dummy proof!  I went into the bathroom and turned on a hot shower to get steam into the air to prevent dust from floating around.  I cleaned the screen with the alcohol pad provided and wiped it down with the included microfiber cloth which made my screen spotless! Tech Armor was also kind enough to include to strips of dust removal tape to get any little pieces I might have missed.  The suction cup is what made this so easy to apply!  It prevents you from accidentally touching the adhesive side of the protector and the fact that you align it up with the home button makes it nearly impossible to align it up incorrectly.  Once I applied it and did the finger swipes, you can see the protector applying!  THIS IS THE FIRST screen protector I've ever had where I have absolutely no air bubbles at all!  I am beyond thrilled with this product!  The icing on the cake is that when I swipe my finger across the screen, it glides so easily that it doesn't even feel like I have a screen protector on!  This product it's first rate from the packaging to the instructions!  The fact that they include a home button sticker to raise it above the protector tells you this product was highly thought out.  It's dummy proof to install and well worth every cent!  I would highly recommend this brand to anyone looking for a quality screen protector!"

I've had it for 35 years and while I rarely (if ever use it) I like the look of it hanging there. It gets pretty grimey and tarnished and some spots are impossible to clean. I looked forward to this product, but found that it did not clean very well. Maybe if I spent an hour rubbing and rubbing it might do the job, but with 14 pieces who has the time and the 1,000 rags/paper towels. So I cleaned my set using that old faithful since 1882 Bar Keeper's Friend and then cleaned with Maas and yes, more tarnish came off. And it was worth recleaning and there is something in Maas that keeps the tarnish away longer than anything else. Perhaps it is because you don't use water to ""clean"" it off that protects the shine. So I am happy enough with that."

If you're gonna spend the $$ on this just spend the extra 100-150 to get a furniture builder or handyman to put together for you.

18690,5,Y,Jewelry,B00B29ZTAE,14k Yellow Gold .10ctw Diamond 8-8.5mm White Button Shape Freshwater Cultured Pearl Stud Earrings,Not what I expected!,"These were purchased as a Xmas gift, so I only saw them on line.  I was extremely happy when I opened them up.  They were larger than what they looked very high quality product.  The only down fall is they are so large that the diamond is not really noticeable unless you are up close.  I would recommend these for anyone who wants to put a smile on someone face when purchasing for a gift."
18692,5,Y,Home Entertainment,B00DOPGO2G,Seiki SE39UY04 39-Inch 4K Ultra HD 120Hz LED TV (Discontinued),Don't overlook this tv!,"This tv/monitor has amazing resolutions and picture quality.  However, it doesn't work well out of the box.<br /><br />1.  Do not use the included HDMI cable.  Do.  Not.  That's the cause of all of the blacking out that the tv has a reputation for.  It's what drove the price down so much from what it started off with.  I've heard that some people have problems with HDMI port 3 (it's the most accessible port, on the left side of the screen) but I switched out the HDMI cable and used that port and I haven't had any problems since.  The HDMI 1.4 is still a regular size HDMI cable.  That's just the speed of the data so if you already have an HDMI cable, use that.  There's no need to buy a new one.  You'll probably be very impressed with the included cable at first because it looks and feels so high-quality.  I couldn't stop oohing and ahhing over it.  However, it's a piece of junk.  Don't even bother unwrapping it.  As a matter of fact, give it to your worst enemy as a gift.<br /><br />2.  Upgrade the firmware, I've used both the 39&#34; and 50&#34; UHD versions.  I switched because I was still having blacking out problems but that stopped after I changed the HDMI cable.  Don't use Seiki's instructions on updating firmware.  Download the firmware on a FAT32 formatted usb stick (any Sandisk one is pre-formatted, you don't need to delete what's already there).  Then put the stick in the USB  port in the tv and turn it on.  Press menu on the remote and 0000.  Then upgrade the firmware.  It could take up to two minutes.<br />http://www.seiki.com/support/downloads.php<br /><br />3.  Go to this address and download 2 things, the custom resolution program, and the pixel patcher.  http://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU?page=1<br /><br />4.  Make sure you read all of the notes on that site, particularly in regards to either deleting Geforce Experience (if you have a Geforce card) or turning off some app in Chrome.  I didn't do that at first and itcaused all kinds of problems.<br /><br />5.  You add and edit resolution in the Nvidia Control Panel or CCC depending on your card but then you apply those resolutions in the regular display dialog box by right clicking on the desktop, going into advanced settings, and list all modes.<br /><br />5.  Check around for settings that have worked for other people with regards to sharpness, color, etc.  Everyone says turn sharpness to 0.  That's what I have mine on that and I'm satisfied with it.<br /><br />I will say that the text looks clearer than pre-4k but the computer monitor colors look a little washed out but only when surfing the net.  When watching movies online or playing games, it doesn't appear washed out at all.  Games look amazing on this.  I mostly play games like State of Decay, Fallout, etc.  Plus, some city building games like Civilization.  I notice some very slight mouse lag when using it to surf (not game) but I had previously read about it so I switched to an optical mouse beforehand so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />I've played everything from 420p to 4k and it always looks great, after the changes mentioned above anyway.  Do not freak out about the quality of the tv until you've done everything mentioned above.<br /><br />Also, the stand that it comes with does not work very well for me.  Right now, my setup looks very haphazard with me using an old shelf to support the tv in the front.  Otherwise the tv would be tipping over.  It's just as well though because the tv doesn't give me enough keyboard room for my desk so I now use the shelf as a keyboard shelf.<br /><br />For those of you who believe the hype about 4k being better than 3D, it is not.  A TV/monitor that is both 4k and 3D is better than 3D. 4K, by itself, is just a really high definition tv.  No more, no less.  The images look much cooler, definitely, but are not nearly as surreal as 3D.  I just kept looking at it and thinking about those photos that people have blown up and use as mural size paintings.  That's the effect of 4K to me.<br /><br />Using the steps above, I am able to get 4K @ 30, 1440P @ 60, and 1080P @ 120.  Video is upscaled even without using the UHD adapter that Seiki sells.  Supposedly, I should qualify for a free one with the purchase of this tv but I haven't ordered it yet.<br /><br />By the way, my setup is a Vishera 6350 FX CPU, 32 GB Ram, and a Geforce GTX 650 (non-ti) graphics card.<br /><br />I hope this review helps people."

18734,5,Y,Outdoors,B005ZGQHAG,Blackburn Angola Key Cable Lock,Looks Formidable & Works Very Well,"The images don't really do this cable justice. In real life, it certainly looks formidable. After over a week of daily use, I have had no problem with any part of this cable. It can be difficult to insert the key in the keyhole, but I think this is an anti-lock picking measure. Unless the thing I'm locking to is quite large, I am usually able to thread the cable through both wheels and frame of my bike. The cable easily stretches out to its full length when you need to use it and easily returns to its coiled form when you need to put it away. The velcro tie that is included is certainly very convenient and useful. All three (identical) keys that came with the cable worked perfectly. I promise to update this review if my bike is stolen and this cable is involved."
18743,5,Y,Toys,B002SQBB3O,Tsuro: The Game of the Path,So much fun!,"I have two game age children. We play A LOT of board and card games. This is one if our favorites. The tiles are substantial enough not to be damaged by rambunctious boys. I hope the game makers don't try to cheapen that aspect up. I really can't stress enough how the game feels well made and is beautiful and can stand up to two boys playing it. The dragon pieces are made of a pleasingly heavy resin. The tiles are heavy, thick cardboard with nice glossy printing. Oh yeah, and it's endlessly fun to play. It is really easy to learn and teach new players. Kids can play independently as long as they are old enough to remember to pick a new tile at the end of each turn. What is really fun about this game is that you can kind of mess with your opponents, but you don't always clearly see how your moves will play out. This is a great game for a group if adults, a few kids or a mix."

We would always buy this shower curtain at Walmart but I have been unable to find it for about a year. Yes over time it does mold & mildew & get soap scum on it, but for those people with those issues please note that mold & mildew issues have to do with ventilation in your bathroom and also how you keep your curtain. If you close it all the time and use a shower mist after showering it will last for years without mildew buildup. We replace ours about every 3-4 years and for $12 how long are you expecting it to last?"

He is an attorney, and I thought its appearance was just his style---elegant and simple.  He takes great care of his belongings.  After 2 months of carrying this brief case, one of the sides ripped from the strap.  This was suppose to be made of leather....instead, it's plastic (or pleather, maybe).  In the beginning, I was suspicious of buying a so called ""quality"" brief case for only $75.  I should've stuck with my instincts.  When the piece arrived, it was evident why this case was so inexpensive. It's definitely something you wouldn't want to carry in front of professionals.  Being the kind soul he is, he carried it until the strap ripped from the side.  I do not advise wasting your time or money.  Since the expiration date for the return was a month after he had it, we are now unable to return for full amt.  I suppose little amt is better than none....we'll see.

We found we kept them on while we were both in the cockpit simply because we could hear and understand each other better.  We are looking at adding another remote; however, the lack of communication between remotes may present a problem - the &#34;remotes&#34; can only talk to the &#34;master,&#34; so the master would have to relay communications between the remotes.

18878,4,Y,Lawn and Garden,B002718IE0,BuffaloTools CNCRSH Deluxe Can Crusher,"It Broke, Was Repaired By My Hand, Works Wonderfully Now","This broke after two days of use. The grip on the handle is just thin foam with a bar that goes through it into a hole on either side of the handle. Originally, the little bar had some flange style stuff going on so that the bar for the grip wouldn't fall off. Those wore away very quickly (I drink a lot of canned seltzer water) and soon the bar fell out which makes the two opposing pieces of the handle separate and go all wonky and uncoordinated. The Good News!: I put the bar in it's rightful place and wrapped the handle (leaving enough room for my hand to move around on the grip as the fulcrum force is applied) with packing tape very tightly and it has since been working like a dream. I love it now. Saves me tons of space in my trash can, but ultimately the can is heavier as there are more cans in it since they fit better crushed."

That lamp, because of its design, (and the design of our Yamaha C3 music bench) would not illuminate the entire sheet of music from top to bottom unless the shade was adjusted (rotated) out...and then the LEDs shined directly into our eyes.  Instead of simply returning the lamp, we called Conoco customer service and found out what a great company this is.  After explaining the issue to the tech, he immediately suggested two other solutions for us: a 14"" lamp with a gooseneck arm between the lamp and clamp, and this 22"" lamp, where the radius of the attachment arms is about twice that of the 19"" lamp.  We chose this one and can only say ""wow!""<br /><br />Not only is the lamp more suitable because of the attachment arm radius, it also has a height adjustment which we've set to accommodate some of the larger page-size, antique sheet music pieces we use.  The light quality and quantity is superb and because of the design of this model, it also illuminates the keyboard, without any light overflow into our eyes.  We absolutely, without reservation, recommend this lamp!<br /><br />One final word about Conoco: not only was the customer service tech helpful in understanding and suggesting solutions to our issue with the first lamp, he went out of his way to make sure we were satisfied.  After making the decision to try this lamp, the first question he asked was ""how can WE do this?"" I suggested going back through Amazon.  His comment was that if we needed any additional help, to just call him.  Overall, a very satisfying customer experience.<br /><br />***Update 12/2013***<br />We just bought a second one of these for our son's family.  Each time they visit, they admire this lamp, so we bought one for them as a gift.  We still love it and use it every day."

After using one these for a couple of days that I borrowed from my friend, I realized why these are $49 more expensive than the QC15's.<br />First of all it is more usable in public, due to is small and sleek design. I wouldn't use a pair of QC15's while walking on the street. Comparing the sound of these two, QC15's has better clarity and surround, but the bass is a little weak. QC's may not have the clairty and surround like the QC15's, but it's an on ear headphone and has a better bass response and well balanced sound, which is perfect for myself personally. I find the rechargeable battery in the QC3's more convenient than the AAA sized batteries in the QC15's. For instance, u run out of batteries in the middle of the night, it wouldn't be very convenient to go out and get batteries, whereas u have the convenience to recharge ur QC3 batteries almost anywhere.<br />I rate the sound, design and ease of use better than the QC15's, not to say that the QC15's are bad, but if you don't mind the weaker bass and u dig the absolute crisp and clarity in a headphone and use it mostly for traveling or at home then QC15 is the way to go. And again this is my personal opinion, which may or may not be the same for everyone.<br />Well I can't thank the BOSE customer service enough.

However the screen protectors are about 1/8"" larger in both height and width and would not adhere properly without being cut down. And there is the rub. It is nearly impossible to cut the screens down to the exact size to fit. This must also be done before the protecting layers are removed or a tremendous amount of dust will be introduced. This was a problem for me and I will have to buy another product that will fit the t4i without cutting.

This particular cross looked perfect - plain but pretty silver, and the shipping weight was 10 pounds (!) so I figured it had to be a bit heavy and at least substantial.<br /><br />I just received it in a bubble envelope - didn't even know what it was at first as the return address listed the name of Larry Sullivan with a residential address (on Amazon it says it's being sold by ""Hail Mary Gifts"", so I thought I was buying from a professional company, not some dude selling cheap trinkets out of his house).<br /><br />I wish I could show a photo of the flimsy, smashed cardboard-with-plastic-cover box the cross came in; even worse, the ""silver"" cross weighs two ounces and is the cheapest little thing you've ever seen! I would return it, but Mr. Sullivan charges a ""20% restocking fee""....so I'm just going to give this to my granddaughter and try to find another gift to add to it - because although it cost $36.00 it looks like something cheesy you'd find at the dollar store. What a joke."

19032,5,N,Lawn and Garden,B00LHN4MVW,Husqvarna ST224 - 24-Inch 208cc Two Stage Electric Start Snowthrower - 961930096,great product but not without some problems.,"the positives, it started up easy, handles great, and can take on snow like a champ.  I have used it all winter in snow from 3-4 inches to 8-11 inches and it is only a matter of taking your time with the deep snow.<br /><br />the negatives, I already lost the bolt that attached to the discharge chute to adjust the height of the spray.  Had to put a bolt i had laying around with some washer in its place to be able to adjust, and this time I put blue loctite on it so it does not go anywhere.  be sure you check the tightness of some of the bolts occasionally or use loctite when putting it together,  Another negative, I assume this is not specific to this make/model, but I used it in 9 inches of snow for 90 minutes, then let my neighbor clear their driveway, and after 90 minutes of them using he returned it saying that the augurs froze.  So I guess I am saying, don't use it in deep snow for an extended period of time because it is possible you will freeze up the fan and augurs, now I need to try to defrost is to be sure that is the real problem and not anything more serious.<br /><br />Overall, it is great, buy it."

Plus,"This is an expensive joke (as well as a huge waster of space).  I bought a ZVOX 450 on the basis of its claims, having never before heard the name, and I had hoped to make dialog more clear -- particularly punch-lines of jokes.  The directions claim it only takes 10 minutes to set up, but I spent 2 frustrating hours before calling ZVOX.  (To their credit, a live United States citizen answered the phone.)  I explained the sound continued to come from the TV speakers as well as the ZVOX causing an echo effect that made most conversation unintelligible.  After half an hour he succeeded in turning off the TV speakers off, but then the ZVOX speakers alone didn't sound any better.  Plus, the mute button no longer worked, so I could no longer avoid those noisy adverts for pills to avoid all sorts of ailments that no one really wants to hear about incessantly.  And certain other functions didn't work either, like the channel-switcher.  After three weeks of only half of what I enjoyed before getting the ZVOX, I called it quits and sent the ZVOX back.  Then I had no sound on my TV, so I had to call Comcast to repair it.  (They gave me a new remote, as the old one had been destroyed in the process of defeating the double speaker problem.  And through all of this the sound quality remained the same, with or without the ZVOX.  So save your money and a huge piece of space (the ZVOX 450 is REALLY big and heavy).  My TV is a four or five year old Samsung, incidentally."

I agree with another reviewer that it was just simply too hot for us.  In only her diaper and the house at 70 degrees she would still get super hot and sweaty.

19200,5,Y,Luggage,B003UVUA4M,Canyon Messenger Bag,"sturdy bag, more masculine design","I thought this bag looked kind of &#34;cute&#34; and bought it for school. My husband wants it though. It's darker in color than shows here..including the leather. I would say it is more of a masculine than feminine design. Under the clipped front flap there is a pocket that doesn't zip or latch shut. This pocket has a nylon type material sewn to the back of it that has the following organizer pockets sewn into it (think like the inside of diaper bag): one 2 1/2 inches wide by 5 3/4 inches long, two pen sized pockets, 3 1/2 inches wide by 5 3/4 inches long, 4 1/2 inches wide by 5 3/4 long with velcro flap to closure. There is also a small zippered side pocket that is about 2 1/2 inches deep by about 5 inches long on the side of this pocket. I would really like this part of the bag if it had a zippered closure on it. Behind this pocket there is a zippered pocket about 9 1/2 inches deep and 13 inches wide. The main part of the bag is behind this and inside the main bag is a zippered pocket about the size of a pouch pencil case (6 inches deep by 10 1/2 wide). The main compartment is roomy and can hold my laptop, several text books and notebooks wihtout being expanded. There is no padding or separation in the main compartment. The back of the bag has a zipper going across the entire back that opens into a pocket. This pocket also unzips at the bottom so that the bag can be slid over luggage handles. The seams seem well sewn. The shoulder strap is adjustable and has a padded area on it for comfort. The zippers work well. The only downsides for me are the plastic clips on the front pocket...so far they are holding up though and the front pocket under the flap,with the organziers not zipping shut."

There is extra room inside the compartment (a small padded non-removable insert), where I stowed the data/video cable with ease. (I suppose this section could also be used to hold virtually any smartphone.) The padding in the compartment provides a decent amount of protection, though just like any sensitive equipment case I would still refrain from dropping it on the ground.<br /><br />There is a nice little compartment on the inside lid which uses a loop of elastic to cover the metal zipper (most likely to prevent it from dangling down on the camera while closed), which is a nice place to store extra memory cards and a screen wipe. The two side compartments are complementary, which I will probably use for extra batteries (since the S4200 uses AAs). The detachable shoulder strap is very good quality and will handle a bit of abuse.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase, considering the prices of other cases out there as well as the reputation Case Logic is known for. If you aren't looking for an elaborate case and like sturdy construction, this is an excellent choice."

I find having to adjust the legs to level the scope is just a hassle. I find it easier to sandbag a rifle. I own a Harris bipod for some of my Tactical rifles but rarely use it. I needed an inexpensive option for my 10-22 so I was looking for something cheap. I saw this for 20.00 and said what the hey and free shipping too ! I was stoked when I received this. This is really well made for 20.00. Machining was a little crude but this is expected from Chinese made products. A hole in the threaded nut for the bipod adapter was drilled a bit off center though. This was a quick fix on the drill press. The adapter fit the Ruger well and looks good. It has a black painted finish. The friction leg nuts and release buttons are nicely finished. Good enough for a .22 or a bolt action .223. The bipod is bulky when folded up and is a bit obtrusive. I would not put it on an assault rifle as it would snag on things when on the move. This a GREAT deal for your non extended magazine rifle like a Ruger 10-22 or maybe an SKS."

19315,5,N,Lawn and Garden,B00N6XBM64,AR Blue Clean AR390SS 2000 psi Electric Power Washer (Blue),A Clean House is a Happy House,"Houses need to be maintained and one area that is often neglected is outside cleaning. Most of us keep our grass cut and the shrubs trimmed, but we often overlook the outside of the house itself. This is where a power washer can help and a good tool for the task is the AR Blue Clean AR390SS Cold Water Electric Pressure Washer.<br /><br />I have used power washers in the past but I never had one to call my own until now. This one is better than the power washers I have experienced previously and probably the main difference is the power. This power washer delivers a whopping 2000 psi of dirt- busting power, easily enough to eliminate the grime and other buildup on the sides of your house or your driveway. I was actually a little worried about the level of power and wondered if it would be too much. This made me hesitate a little at first, but once I started to clean, my worries vanished, my confidence increased, and I continued to wash my siding at a fast pace. You can, of course, dial down the pressure a little, but the 2000 psi is fine for most uses and makes the task of cleaning the siding or driveway that much easier and faster.<br /><br />This power washer comes with several attachments like a turbo nozzle, pencil nozzle, fan spray nozzle, and detergent nozzle. These different tips are an improvement compared to the power washers I have used in the past. They allow you to select the right tool for the task, for the best overall cleaning. I haven‚Äôt used any detergent or cleaner yet and have used primarily the turbo nozzle since it delivers the strongest stream of water. But it‚Äôs nice to know that the other options are available when I need them.<br /><br />I like the reel on this power washer and I like the ease of storage. The power cord is fine for my house because I have outside electrical outlets on each side of my house. If your home has fewer, you may need an extension cord. Other than that, I can‚Äôt find many bad things at all to say about this powerwasher. It gets the job done and exceeds expectations on most all levels, making it an excellent choice for outdoor cleaning needs."

Both McConaughey and Harrelson are perfect as the loner-atheist iconoclast thrust into a partnership with the seemingly happily married man who believes in everything he should. After ten years, the discovery of another body killed in a style exactly like that of the murderer they apprehended brings them back together to be interrogated about the particulars of the original case. Contrasting their present positions in life and beliefs with their former ones, it's a chronicle of flawed characters searching for an even more broken one. (I really felt McConaughey's character, being the man full of esoteric knowledge,  should've reconized the symbolism of the antlers, however, but that might've ruins it as far as the length of the series.)<br /><br />This review is for Disc One but I have no doubts it will stand for the other discs also, and if my hunch is correct about the story's outcome...WOW!"

19443,5,N,Video Games,B000035Y76,Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals,20 years of off and on playing,"I first played this on an original SNES about 18 years ago.  I have since lost both system and game (dammit) but have found the wonderful world of emulators.  It's still my go-to game for when I'm bored or get tired of dying on Call of Duty.  The Ancient Cave is unbeatable, I have yet to find all the Iris Treasures, most of the puzzles are second nature for me now, but when I was eight, it was actually pretty challenging.  It has outstanding game play and the graphics are right on par with the others at the time.  1996 was quite some time ago and even though there were a few games to push the barrier (StarFox, Secrets of Mana, etc) it was right on par with all the others.  Turn based RPG's were the heat for me so this obviously meets the mark.  I think it is a shame that they followed it up with Lufia but whats done is done.  Bottom line: one of my top 3 games of all time and an all around good play for all ages."

I have 3 of them. I use a Cowboy studio trigger to fire one and the other twos slave function and they work perfect. I also get f11 no problem shooting thru umbrellas at about half power.. Which leads to the only real con I can find.. These lights could use more power adjustments

I am replacing an older G-Shock watch that has rubber bands. I replaced the rubber bands twice and after about 10 years the solar window on the older watch began to cloud. I gave it to a friend.

I have received tons of compliments on it and was very pleased with the size because I am a Mom of 4 and could stash some baby essentials in it when I didn't feel like carrying my large diaper bag.<br />However, after using the bag full time for almost 2 months, one of the leather straps broke away from the purse. The leather tore where the strap is fastened and I can see no easy way to repair. I do carry a lot in my purse but nothing really excessive; I would expect a bag this size to hold up to a little extra weight. I'd love to exchange and see if the replacement bag lasts longer but I am outside the 30 day warranty."

It's nice to be able to complete a workout video without having to stop because the moves are too complicated or I feel like I'm gonna die!  I still feel like I had a great workout and my sore body shows it the next day.

19480,1,Y,Video DVD,B005TQAI6G,Britney Spears Live: The Femme Fatale Tour,WARNING! PLEASE DO NOT BUY!,I would have given this a zero rating if possible! This DVD is a complete and total utter piece of garbage! The choreography is off key and bad. She is very stiff and barely dancing other than a few poorly coordinated movements and the WORST OF ALL...she is LIP SYNCING!!!! This is totally unacceptable! I understand that Brit is one of those studio artists but I would have preferred to hear her voice a little unsteady or poorly controlled than the studio track over crappy choreography! I'm disappointed because I love Brit and her music since &#34;Bay One More Time&#34; and her comeback from the bipolar breakdown was commendable but this is not her standard whatsoever. I'll still buy her cd's because her music is very upbeat simple dancey pop. No ballads or deep moving music. Just fun upbeat dance clubbing with friends. The DVD was painful to watch. I couldn't even make it through the first set. I will be demanding my refund as well as all of us who wasted $15. It would be great if we could all file a class action lawsuit to demand a ban on the sale of this fraudulent p.o.s.

They became hard in the compost pile, and they didn't want to break down into the lovely texture of compost. This was the answer. The stuff that comes out of this is like an old forest floor. I can't wait to spread it around in my garden this year."
19490,5,Y,Video DVD,B007OXB1GI,Private Romeo,The concept here is like that of a traditional musical or opera,"This is not actually the story of Romeo and Juliet, but is rather the story of a group of boys in a military academy and a romance between two of them, told using (mostly, but not entirely) the text of Shakespeare's play. The two lovers are NOT Romeo and Juliet; they are Sam and Glenn, who use the lines of R & J as a way of expressing their thoughts and emotions. The concept here is like that of a traditional musical or opera, in which the story is expressed through songs which aren't meant to be taken literally (that is, the characters themselves aren't really singing--the actors are singing to express the characters). Here, the actors are using the text of a Shakespeare play to tell a different story. (The ending makes it clear that it is a different story.)<br /><br />The actors here are superb, and make the text come alive in a way that I've never experienced before. (And it certainly doesn't hurt that they are SO easy on the eyes!)  Rather than stuffy and/or wooden delivery in affected British accents, we get line readings that sound like actual live humans speaking to each other.  All of the actors had experience performing Shakespeare, although for some this was their first time doing so professionally.  Hale Appleman is especially good, and should have a very successful career ahead of him.<br /><br />I saw this at the Reeling film festival in Chicago a few years ago, and it was my very favorite film out of the couple dozen that I saw that year."

19495,4,Y,Baby,B000H1IYXW,"Regalo Hide Away Extra Long Bed Rail, White",Works with futon bed,"Works really well, have had no problems at all. I am using it on a full size futon, so the straps are between a futon mattress and a wooden futon bed frame. I took a chance and I'm glad I did, it tilts inward a little (and it is difficult to hide rail under because futon is not stiff like a mattress), but am very happy with how it is working. Would have gave 5 stars if only they could have put that huge blue paragraph of warning text someplace else- it is unsightly. You either have to look at is while in bed or turn it out so you see it while outside the bed."

It allows me to sleep well knowing that if anything were to go wrong, the Snuza would go off and alert me.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- easy to clip on and turn on<br />- provides peace of mind<br /><br />Cons:<br />- false alarms until you get the hand of how to attach it so it doesn't slide off at night<br />- once the baby starts turning on to their tummy I don't see how this could used as it is too bulky to sleep on<br /><br />amazon also has the 'Snuza go!' which is cheaper but is almost the same item:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002WLGV08 B002WLGV08]]"

The only thing that may be a turn of for some people is that its &#34;only&#34; 720p rather than 1080p but personally that makes no difference to me."

All of the images transfer very well and every little detail appears, no need to stamp with konad polishes. I recommend using klean color black polish which can be found at daiso for $1.50.

19509,5,N,Video DVD,B000G0O5F0,Sesame Street - Elmo's Potty Time,Great Inspiration for Using the Potty,"My 18-month old adores Elmo, so when we started potty training we got this video.  She loves it!  Especially helpful for us has been the segment where different kids say what they call ""pee"" and ""poo."". It gets her talking about urine and BMs.  Sometimes I think she doesn't want to admit that she does pee and poo, but when she sees the kids and Curly Bear talk about it, she feels it's OK.  We also quote Grover a lot, ""I've got that got to go feeling. I've got to go!"". We watched the video multiple times as a family and it gave us a common, family vocab for talking about all that goes into using the potty.  And I learned more than I knew before about bow toilet paper is made from the ""Visit to the Factory"" segment."

19523,4,Y,Home Entertainment,B00FQEE0T2,LG Electronics LAP340 Wireless Soundplate Surround Sound Speaker System (2013 Model),Blown away,Paired the LAP 340 to my LG 55 inch LED HD TV and the sound was incredible! I believe the larger TV's have just average sound compared to 40 inch or less so you need something to enhance the sound on the larger sets. The Sound Plate fit right under my 55 inch and immediately improved the voice clarity and broadened  the depth of the other sound frequencies. And that was BEFORE I hit the &#34;Cinema&#34; button!!! I was blown away (and so was the wife) by the sound. I disconnected my 6 speaker surround sound system and put it back in the box it came in. Great product at a real good price. I'm throughly satisfied!

So far I have not yet played other DVD's on it so I cannot tell whether it would play Pal DVD or not. But I guess it will. This blue ray player is the nearest to tv set top box. I do not like squinting to watch videos on smart phone or tablet. But the blue ray player enables to watch videos and even news on regular television. I could dispense with my cable television but for local news and children's programs such as cartoon network and Nick. the player gives me access to both free programs and paid services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon."

My second time using the green bag, the zipper split open in the wash and my daughter's delicate sweater came out.  My return window ended a week ago so now I'm stuck with crappy bags that I can't trust to work as intended.<br /><br />I bought a small bag at &#34;kaymart&#34; a year ago.  It was much better quality and has held up well.  If you're shopping for mesh bags, you obviously care about your clothes.  I never thought I'd say this... but this is one item you should buy in person -- make sure they have good zippers!"

Only downside, as others have mentioned, it's very bulky which makes it a bit annoying to store when not in use.  Would be better if it folded instead of rolled."
19563,4,Y,Camera,B006XE4SSM,Bobber - Floating Hand Grip for GoPro¬Æ HERO Cameras,Awesome Product,This is another awesome product for GoPro cameras. It fits in your hand nicely and will most likely not slip even if your hand is wet. If you let go of it in the water it will flip with the camera down making it easy to see because it is bright yellow. The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because the strap for your wrist is connected to the handle by very thin string(you can see it in the picture.) I'm not positive but it looks like it could come off pretty easily. But this is not a big deal because you can simply buy a different one for less than 5 dollars. Definitely worth it if you film in the water.

Sticks directly to my dash and it doen't fall off... The quick snap feature is really cool too.  Update: I took away a star because the suction cup will damage any dash that has any kind of cover on it. Luckily I saw other reviews that stated this so I got it off of my covered dash before it did too much damage. There are however permanent indention on the dash even after 6 months. It is great, however for my gf's dash because it is just hard plastic so there is nothing to ruin."

19583,4,N,Baby,B0069209FY,"Delta Children Universal 6 Drawer Dresser, Espresso Cherry",Easy to assemble,"This dresser is really easy to assemble. It comes with an alen wrench and you also need a Philips screw driver (the one that looks like an X). Personally, I would suggest a cordless drill just to save your hands and it will also decrease the time needed to assemble this dresser. The pieces all came clearly labeled and any holes properly drilled in the correct location. The drawers took the most amount of time to assemble as there were six of them. The main pieces slide together really easily. After you put the first side up the next step was to place the center piece in place. Prior to doing this don't forget to put in the front dresser trim pieces in place. Overall with two people you should be able to assemble this in about an hour. The total steps to assemble are 8 (including all drawers as two steps.<br /><br />Overall the quality seems to be really good. It is made of real wood and is sturdy."
19585,5,Y,Baby,B004AHMCKA,Sassy Wonder Wheel Activity Center,Great Toy!,I purchased this for my son when he was about 6 months old.  We use it at dinner time to keep him occupied after he is done eating (and while we eat!). It has been one of the best purchases I have ever made toy wise. There are so many things for him to do and every week he discovers something else.  We've been using it for 5 months (almost 6) and it STILL entertains him. The suction cup is perfect for a high chair tray and it washes easily with a washcloth.

19590,3,Y,Outdoors,B008OO7LCO,Suspenz Folding Wall Mount Kayak Rack,Not for small garages with multiple recreational kayaks.,"This rack works perfect in a large garage or in a small one that is empty. Unfortunately my garage is a one car unit with a car and many boxes in it. If I had only one kayak to mount this would work perfect. However, I need to mount two on top of each other. The ceiling is only 9' tall. Mounting just one set would require to use at least half of that space which leaves no room for the second kayak's mount.<br />If you have limited wall space choose a different model. I would recommend the ones that are ""L"" shaped instead of the ""U"" shaped ones."

Mine tipped over several times when I first put it out - I think it was the cats and maybe the squirrels getting used to a light-weight bird bath after my heavy cement one.  Now it stays upright.  The birds do use it; haven't seen a squirrel on it yet but that doesn't mean they haven't been there.  I see a lot of reviews mention rust.  I sprayed it w/a clear rust-stopper paint.

I am Scottish/Japanese/Sicilian, it's like wire growing out of my face.<br />After the first use out of the shower, I could already feel a difference. After using it for a week, I'm convinced that it not only works, but that I will continue to use it. I also started combing my beard with a Kent handmade comb, and it really helps get the oil worked in quickly without a bunch of rubbing. The oil is also great for my skin, I rub it all over my face after I put it on my beard.<br />Huge difference in texture and comfort. Love it.<br />Bonus:<br />My girlfriend loves the way my beard feels, and is always touching it now. Although sometimes she pets it, which is a little weird.<br />My kids like it too, which makes me happy."
19618,4,N,Video Games,B004EQCCI4,Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception - Playstation 3,"Half REcharted, but it gets better as you progress...","For the first few hours, Uncharted 3 felt like a rehash of Uncharted 2. Several portions of the game are nearly identical to the last one: the same platforming, combat, and story elements reappear. That's not to say it's bad by any means...it just takes a while to set itself apart. It wasn't until halfway in (about 5 hours) that things started to get interesting; there are some great set pieces and surprising turns that develop which help break up the monotony.<br /><br />Graphically, the game looks amazing, especially in the later areas. There is some texture tearing, and anti-aliasing problems (jaggies) in places that take away from otherwise beautiful renderings. The game looks very dark and gritty in places, and sometimes I wondered if the resolution was TOO high. The majority of it is great though, with varied environments, solid character designs and well-choreographed cut scenes. In terms of music and sound, they did the usual outstanding job. Voice acting is top notch, though the actors telegraph things a bit often (""Grab that door, will you?"" ""Okay"" ""Got it?"" Yeah""). The music builds on the themes from the previous games while adding things to the mix depending on the region you're in.<br /><br />There's not much to say about the gameplay; if you played the last game, this one offers more of the same. Some of the same issues reappear - I popped out of cover when I didn't want to, and aiming is often annoying, as where the reticle pops in rarely syncs up perfectly with where you're looking. There are upgrades to combat that make Drake seem like Batman (taking out a room full of mercenaries bare-knuckled) or Superman (surviving in the desert for days and then battling hundreds of bad guys with no water, food or rest), but like the improvement in grenade tossing from UC to UC2, these are a nice addition. Drake seems to live a charmed life, as every time things come crashing down around him there's always a net to catch or ledge to hang onto...not to say theseweren't present in UC2, but here they happen so often it sort of takes away the sense of danger. The puzzles are interesting and usually enjoyable, though not as challenging as the last game (the clues are either right around you or in Drake's notebook). Thankfully, there were only a couple times when I got lost or stuck in a room...a definite improvement over UC2. Treasure hunting is a mixed bag - I searched most areas thoroughly and only got 41 out of 100, so the others must require a lot of effort to find. I wish there was a way to play through the game again with a reduction in enemies, as they are mainly an annoyance when you just want to explore and enjoy the scenery.<br /><br />The story in the game is fine in a general sense, but there are times when it felt like things were overlooked or missing altogether. Once again we have a lengthy flashback sequence, though this time it helps to flesh out the relationships between Drake, Sully and Marlowe (the villainess). In my review of UC2, I mentioned that there were only two female characters in the game, so having a female adversary here is a welcome addition. Her motivations are interesting, and it's great how all the little discoveries Drake makes add up to a big revelation in the end. It makes it all the more worthwhile when you take her down. There are parts of the game that could have been better thought out though. For instance, there is a point where the four heroes split into two groups to find two halves of a clue. You control Drake and Sully and head through a French chateau (until you're attacked by Marlowe's men), then head to Syria to check on the progress of Chloe and Cutter (a new character)...only to find them perfectly well. It felt like there was a missing section where we could play as the second duo for a while, but nope, apparently they've just been wandering around inside a castle for a few days. I do have to give the game points for keeping Sully involved (he was sorely missed when he leftin UC2) and bringing Elena back. There are logic gaps here and there (the way a drug affects its target; how Marlowe's men ALWAYS come after Drake no matter where in the world he is), but the reaches back into the series' past help to make up for them.<br /><br />All in all, I would say UC3 gradually becomes an enjoyable game, with some memorable scenes (including evacuations from a sinking cruise ship and exploding cargo plane) and wonderful areas (the chateau, a massive desert, underground caverns that will amaze you) in addition to the gameplay and characters you remember. The producers have mentioned that they only want to continue the series if they can top themselves again, and it would be hard to beat the exciting sequences that come into play here. I'm not sure how they could improve upon things - climbing hundreds of walls and facing waves of enemies again is a given (but not all that appealing), and Drake's already survived train, plane and boat crashes as well as ancient cities crumbling around him...not to mention multiple brushes with the supernatural. What else can he overcome?"

19780,2,Y,Furniture,B004CVKXHS,"Altra Jacob Laptop Cart, Cherry/Black",For the price and utility this was a great choice. I love having the multi-position slant for ...,"Updating -- About a month after I purchased it, I made the mistake of resting my elbow on my laptop and leaning on it.  Snap!  The &#34;support&#34; between the two sides of the table is a plastic pipe about an inch in diameter, and the weight made it crack.  Now my left (laptop) side of the table lists down about four inches.  If they could replace the support bar with something made of a strong metal (I'm surprised this wasn't the case originally, since otherwise it seems to be pretty well built), I'd be happy.  Otherwise, it's now useless to me.  I've tried several different things to prop it up, but without the pipe being replaced with something sturdier, it just won't work.  ********* I assembled it in about 30 minutes, and it's just what I needed.  I have another similar one I bought several years ago which is heavier-duty, but it also cost about three times as much.  For the price and utility this was a great choice.  I love having the multi-position slant for my laptop while also having the smaller stationary shelf, not only for my wireless mouse but for other small items I may want to keep nearby.  The wheels don't roll as smoothly as I'd like on carpet, but I figure if these really bother me I can easily replace them with sturdier casters."
19781,1,Y,Health & Personal Care,B0009STN0Q,"Duro-Med Walker Pouch, Multi-Pocket Carry-All Bag, Blue Denim",color faded on pocket fabric only?! Ugly.,"On the up side, this seems to function fine and my mother uses it only around the house so the way it looks isn't so very important to us. However.... the fabric on the pockets is an extremely faded denim (as if exposed to the sun for a very long time, seemingly not intentional or evenly faded) and the back side and part that goes over the bar is the dark fabric as shown. It looks awful. I would not recommend buying this particular one if you care at all how it looks. It looked very old and very used upon arrival. My mom says it is fine and won't let me &#34;go through the trouble&#34; of returning it, but I'm not happy that I ordered this ugly thing for her. :("

19789,5,Y,PC,B009WYJD5I,Poetic ThinShell Back Smart Cover Partner Case for iPad Mini Clear,Excellent companion to Smart Cover.,"If you're trying to keep your iPad Mini truly mini, do yourself a favor and get this case.<br /><br />It clamps on to the corners of the iPad and sits flush with the screen, not extending above or over it. The cut outs for the power switch, volume controls, microphones, etc are all perfectly matched to the iPad Mini with Retina display. It's easy to install, essentially snapping into place, and there's a long cutout on the side for the Apple Smart Cover to attach/remove without having to remove the Poetic case. The Smart Cover easily folds back over the case as if it weren't even there.<br /><br />This is designed mostly as a scratch prevention case, not drop protection, and in that sense it perfectly compliments the Smart Cover. It adds minimal thickness (a few millimeters) and minimal weight to the iPad.<br /><br />This is the sort of thing Apple should have invented and charged $50 for. The Apple Smart Case provides similar coverage as this combo, but it costs a lot more. Now if Poetic would only make an inexpensive magnetic screen cover to replace the Smart Cover at a fraction of the price, they'd make a killing."

19804,3,N,Video DVD,B001GDSO4Y,Aska: Japanese Drum,Great Drumming; Thread Bare Production,"Performances = 3-1/2 stars; DVD production values = barely 2 stars.  Overall, very fine drumming especially for the first and last sets.  Impact is significantly reduced by minimally creative camera work and unimaginative video editing.  Highly repetitive shots (which exclude some performer close-ups) seems to indicate that an inadequate number of cameras were used and only a single recording of each set was made.  Audio is an insult to the performers!  Stereo only.  Poor placement of microphones and/or inadequate audio editing results in a loss of stage sound from front to rear--only instruments up front (or close to the front) can be heard the best or at all.

Tried using the antennae to boost but it wouldnt make a difference. Setup was easy. Some of the features are ok like motion etc but others like the geofense make no sense. You cant triangulate or make a rectangle ...its just a line that needs to be crossed.

This AMAZING product is gentle on wood, while cleaning it to perfection. My husband and I, love this product because it does not leave a waxy build up.  It is the BEST wood cleaner around. I have tried other products before discovering MINWAX WOOD CLEANER and there is no turning back. This 'magical' cleaner should not be a secret! I could not find MINWAX WOOD CLEANER in Canada, so I ordered two (2) cases of it online, from the United States. When it arrived to our home, I was happier than a child who had just recieved a present in the mail, of toys and penny candy.  I have squirreled away bottles of this incredible product, so that I am not without. I cannot say enough about MINWAX WOOD CLEANER because first of all the trigger spray bottle is user friendly and the rippled  sides of the bottle are super-easy to grip. The design of the bottle is intelligent, because your fingers easily wrap around the trigger spray bottle, making it a charm to use.  The contents, inside the bottle...the wood cleaner is something that needs to be highly advertised because this really is the cream of the crop product, for cleaning your wood. Wooden furniture and wooden cabinets are expensive and this product takes excellent care of one's wood. I do not like products that leaves a waxy, shinny, artificially coated build up that wrecks the wood. MINWAX lubricates all types of  wood and it really provides a RED CARPET feeling with regards to wood cleaning!!! Great products means great results and this is what MINWAX WOOD CLEANER IS ALL ABOUT.  MINWAX does NOT leave a coated film of any kind, which is SO VERY IMPORTANT.  I only want the best for my wood....MINWAX FLOOR CLEANER IS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR MY WOOD and I ONLY use MINWAX WOOD CLEANER and will NEVER use another brand.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!"

19877,4,N,Home,B002NQMZSO,"Arrow Sewing Cabinets 601 Gidget, Sewing Table, White",It Works but needs a lot of Improvements,"We looked years for a sewing table & even thought about using a normal table by raising a chair with a small step platform to get comfortable. We even went to several quitting shows & the sewing tables there went for $1000 of dollars with electric lowering sewing boards. We finally bought the Arrow Sewing cabinet because it's lowering sewing board of 7-3/8 inches wide by 17-1/2 long fitted perfectly with our Juki 2010Q sewing machine whose base is 7 inches wide by 17 inches long. The main table is made of MDF wood at 40 inches long by 19-3/4 inches wide & comes fully assembled. The two legs pull out & lock in place at 28-1/2 inches high just right for a middle size woman to sit & sew without hurting her back. The lowering chain needed to be unscrewed & put up one chain to fit the Juki 2010Q sewing machine because the adjustment screw wasn't raising the sewing board to the right level to the main table. The cut out sewing board is very poorly done & I read several other reviews in Amazon where they added sealant to protect the sewing machine & fill in the gaps between the sewing machine & the main table. I am thinking of adding a thick tape to cover the rough edges. Also the sewing board is held by a thin chain that is not centered with the adjusting screw, therefore the sewing machine maybe slightly off from level. The main table does move when you wiggle it so we thought it would shake when sewing. We tested the whole table with our Juki 2010Q sewing machine, which is a 1500 SPM straight stitching machine & ran it at full speed. The whole table surprising held up.<br /><br />Question: so people have to add or fix the table to their liking? I guess so at around $120.00 which makes a rating of 4. A better cut of the sewing board from the main table & 2 adjustable chains would of made a rating of 5."

Very courteous, professional and polite. They very obviously value customer service. All of my rings are princess/emerald cut, so originally I had picked out the sqaure design version of the bracelet. When I went to order it though, it had been sold, so I bought the round cut one instead as a second choice. I was worried about the round shape clashing with the square shape of my engagement ring, but as it turned out, it looked gorgeous and didn't clash AT ALL. On a whim I contacted the seller and inquired about the square cut version that had been sold. The seller got back to me immediately and said it was sold, but if I was still interested he would order another one for me. I was totally floored. I did not think customer service existed at that level before. Within the week, the seller contacted me to tell me that he received the square version and JUST listed it on amazon. I immediately ordered it. Within 2 days my bracelet arrived. It is absolutely stunning. I have had it for a month and have not taken it off since it arrived.

After these two issues were solved they are performing great.  The only other thing was one of the devices had a broken RG-6 cable but that was easily fixed.

19928,5,Y,Home,B008VNXNAM,"Serenia Sleep Dunlop Latex 2-Inch Easy Flip Mattress Pad Topper with Cover, King",Best fit for a bad back,"My wife has a bad back (scoliosis), so her chiropractor recommended a firm mattress. So 3 years ago we bought a nice S&F mattress, which had the support, but was too firm on the pressure points. A topper from BBB worked for a couple years, but then it must have worn out and she was getting a lot of pain again. So we tried out a number of different options, including a SN bed, a gel memory foam, this one, and a poly fill topper. The SN bed was a glorified air mattress, which did not help at all and cost as much as our king sized bedroom set. The gel memory foam did not make it out of the package, since the memory foams hadn't worked in the past. The latex was okay at first, but she didn't love it and wanted to try another one. The poly fill topper felt great at first (&#34;like a cloud&#34;), but was compressed by morning and the aches were back. At this point, we gave the latex another shot and after a week, realized that her back pain was gone!<br /><br />While I'm not picky about what I sleep on, I love the latex too. While the cost is higher than some other options, it has the perfect combination of comfort and support (and is much cheaper than a new bed). Summer is just getting started, but so far it has been as cool as anything else. The quality of this topper is the best I have seen, with a cover that makes it simple to install and rotate. The straps on the cover have no issues fitting over our extra deep mattress. A note on size: it does not extend the full dimensions of the bed, but leaves ~1&#34; all around to help the sheets fit.<br /><br />Customer service and communication from the seller is top notch. I had a minor issue when we received it, and they settled it immediately. Thanks!"

It matches great with my wedding band, which is just a solid band of Titanium. The stones sparkle more than my actual diamond ring. The center stone does not sit up high so it doesn't catch on things. And the price is right! It came packaged well.The shipping was very fast so I received the ring before my anniversary which was awesome. My only complaint is that now I will continue to shop with Sonia Jewels, which might weigh heavy on my pocket book."

19943,2,Y,Furniture,B0019MAUTE,Z-Line Belaire Glass L-Shaped Computer Desk,"Looks nice, but quality is horribly lacking.","There was either a problem with the packaging or the carrier. Mine was sent by CEVA. The main box was torn up substantially. It was so bad an entire corner was almost entirely ripped off. There were several other holes in the main box. There were a couple of other boxes inside the main box and they didn't look much better.<br /><br />Now moving on to the actual product. First of all, it's made in china and it showed in mine. The black metal had scrapes on it in multiple places. Some pieces were worse than others. 2 of the 5 glass pieces had scratches. One was very noticeable. The glass is attached to the desk by several suction cups. The product was also covered in little shaving that another reviewer said was fiberglass strands. Not sure if that's exactly what they were, but my product was covered in them.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this desk because it looks nice. Amazon wouldn't send me individual parts so I'm probably to attempt to contact the manufacturer. If that works, great..otherwise, I'll be returning this for a full refund.  I don't want to risk exchanging this product for another one because I don't want to wait a week and then risk getting crap back."

19951,5,N,Baby,B000EFOQMO,Flying Falcon Infant Car Seat Carrier,DO NOT LISTEN TO NEGATIVE REVIEWS,"I too am an avid baby wearer and this car seat carrier has NOTHING to do with baby wearing.  This car seat carrier is for carrying your baby, in an infant car seat, to and from places where you would not bring a stroller or carrier (e.g. a restaurant, friends houses).  Even a short two-three minute walk from a parking space to your destination can be very difficult while lugging a heavy and cumbersome car seat.  The seat bangs against the side of your leg, makes it very difficult to carry diapers bags or other things, and limits your ability to help your other kiddos (if you have them).  I did not have this car seat carrier with my first two babes and I can still remember, VERY CLEARLY, the dreaded infant car seat days.  I am so excited to have it with my third child!!!  And yes, I will be wearing my baby tons and no I won't be walking around with the car seat hanging off of me for long walks or visits as some reviewers have suggested.  Duh."

Wonderful title, and the story didn't let me know."

19985,5,N,Video DVD,B008B9JSD2,We Have a Pope,"Funny, touching, thought-provoking","I can't imagine how Mr. Moretti must be feeling right now. He makes this excellent movie about a pope-elect that has serious doubts about whether he is able to perform his duties and a couple of years later a sitting pope announces his resignation, the first in 600 years.<br />However, amazing as this movie's timing is, there are plenty of other good reasons to enjoy it, starting with Michel Piccoli's career-best performance. Nanni Moretti does his usual great work as actor and director.<br />As an atheist myself, I can say that no matter what religious beliefs you do or do not have, this movie can make you laugh, cry and think like very few others."

Not only did I get a great price on Amazon, the television arrived in great condition before it was even scheduled to arrive.  The picture on this TV is amazing.  We have watched several 3D Blu Ray movies on this LG TV and the 3D effects are very cool.  I recommend this TV to anyone."

I just needed a new controller and thought I would try this. I almost sent it back, because it was making the automatic guns slower, by a lot when using rapid fire. I read some more on the controller and figured out the rapid fire is for single shot only. Pistols and FAL are my favorite on Black Ops II. I really enjoy the auto aim too, you just pull the trigger and it aims at the same time. The quick scoping is fun to play with too. If you need a new controller or just wanna play with the mods, get one of these. FUN!"

19999,3,Y,Apparel,B0058ZZ3X6,"Lucky Brand Women's Vale Easy Rider Jean in Ol Sun Shower, Ol Sun Shower Wash, 31x32",Roomier jeans circa 1995,I got a size 12/31 which in my other Lucky Brand Zoe Bootcut jeans fit well. These were big around the waist which I was happy about because with Lucky Brand it can be hit or miss. I like them because they are much roomier and for women who have hips and thighs (like myself) the Easy Rider if they shrink will still look good. The price was great and I liked the subtle details on the back side. They are a faded circa 1995 sort of denim but they feel soft and I think they will survive many washings without completely fading. I have recently joined the Lucky Brand denim fad because through Amazon the jeans are much more affordable than at the Lucky brand store. $99 at the Lucky Brand store and their own website  is pretty high to pay for jeans especially in today's economy.
20002,2,Y,Furniture,B000LPFUG8,Folding Shopping Cart - Versacart Utility Cart - Transport Up to 120 Pounds (Water-Resistant Heavy Duty Canvas),The cart was wonderful for about two weeks,"The cart was wonderful for about two weeks.  It came in very handy helping move from a townhouse to a condo.  Then, all of a sudden, these two metal bars attached to each other at the bottom and back of the card became severely bent.  It obviously didn't do that itself.  I probably tried to fold the cart improperly. Now I have a cart that will not fold to stow away.  Space is important in a condo.  Be careful how you open and close the cart.  I don't think it takes a lot of strength to bend these bars."

I was counting on a reknowned name like Remington pertaining a good quality merchandise but suprisingly on the left side of the black blade the name *CHINA* is stamped in bright red.

She says she has to go to the bathroom just so she can use it.  It changes colors every shade of the rainbow and turns off automatically after 10 mins or so.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the base has to be constantly plugged in or it looses it's charge within hours.  I like to have the least number of things plugged in as possible but unfortanately this item needs an outlet always.<br /><br />It's great for little hands, doesn't require perfect position to go onto the base and is just bright enough for children to feel like their not in the dark, but not so bright that you fully wake up out of dreamland.<br /><br />I bought 2 more for my nephews and they love them too!"

20026,5,Y,Video DVD,B002ZTQVHK,Castle in the Sky,One of Miyazaki's Best,"I am biased.  I love all the Miyazaki / Studio Ghibli anime movies I have seen.  That said, this is one of my favorites.  It is slightly less over-bearing in its anti-war message than Nausicaa Valley of the Wind and its animation is as stunning.  The sky pirates provide great comic relief, and the two main child characters are relatable.  The only downfall is the villain, who reminds me a little of the villain in Origin: Spirits of the Past in his overbearing paternalism.<br /><br />Watch this movie for its beautiful music and animation.  You won't be disappointed."

20033,5,Y,Sports,B002EDM7J8,NcStar Tactical DIGITAL CAMO Pack,"Sweet backpack, well made, great deal","I thought this was a steal at $25! This is a well made bag, with a lot of space and lots of pockets. The main compartment can hold my boots, half face mask, helmet and goggles. There two secondary pockets on the front that also can hold a bunch of stuff and there two small pockets on each side (4 total) of the bag that can hold smaller stuff.  On the inside of the main compartment is a zipper pouch that can hold stuff as well. The bag has molle straps on the front and also on the bottom of the bag.  There are adjustable straps for the chest and for the waist so the bag is very secure. There are also straps that can wrap around the front to hold and tie down additional stuff if needed, I thought that was a nice touch.  Overall, I thought I got a lot for $25, and I like that the bag is well made and strong, and the zippers are good quality. Sometimes you sort of gamble when you order online because you cant see the product first hand before you buy, this is one of those items where I feel like the gamble paid off and I got a good deal for an awesome item. To be fair, I have seen nicer bags with a lot more perks, but I'm using this bag for my airsoft gear and its perfect for that. I will also be using this bag for hiking and camping. Love it!"

Recipes seem to be untested and do not produce the results in the pictures.<br />2  The first part of the book is just a rehash of the excellent book Wheat Belly.  If I had wanted to re-read the Wheat Belly book I would have read it again and not bothered to purchase a ""cook book"" that just rehashes the same thing for a number of chapters.<br />3.  While I really appreciate the author's research, writing and this important health information the cook book was a let down.  There are other cookbooks one can use their common sense and adapt to gluten free, a more thorough explanation on how to do that would have been appreciated more than some non workable recipes with disappointing results for the expense of the ingredients and the time involved.<br />4.  The challenge here is for a great cook to come up with some recipes that taste excellent, are gluten free and actually work.<br /><br />Wheat Belly is worth the price and more, the Wheat Belly Cookbook was a complete waste of money in my opinion.<br /><br />I love cooking and am used to being adaptable in the kitchen with decades of experience.  The first recipe I used, the pancakes with coconut flour was not remotely accurate in terms of flour/liquid proportions.  Following instructions left me with a mixture that could not be made into pancake.  I adapted it with more liquids and had a crumbly waste of expensive ingredients that turned to crumbs when trying to turn them on the grill.  I wondered if this recipe was tested at all.  After that disaster which ended up in the garbage disposal I'm not going to try any more of the recipes that are bread product replacements.<br /><br />While I haven't tried all the recipes my initial attempts have disappointed someone who loves to cook"

But the bottom of the case where your pinky finger rests is not comfortable. The cut outs almost feel sharp or abrasive...to the point I felt the need to mention it here. I can't unnotice it.
20181,3,Y,Wireless,B002VPE1QG,AmazonBasics Universal Travel Case for Small Electronics and Accessories -Black,Will be returning it,"It's a nice size and design to hold your small gadgets and a few chargers either in your briefcase or in your carry-on luggage while traveling. However, I expected better quality from Amazon, notwithstanding the Amazon ""basics"" designation.  The zipper seems a bit slack and as if it would not be stable with repeated use, however, that is just a guess since I haven't used it repeatedly.  The real reason I'm returning it is the strange and offensive odor.  Why on earth should this product have a strong smell that doesn't go away? I was surprised by the odor, of smoke and burned plastic. The case did not appear damaged in any way, and was sent in cardboard packaging, so the offensive odor of burned plastic had to come from the case. Maybe it was made of cheaply recycled plastic (like, melted down by someone at home)? That's all I can think of that would lead to this bad smell.  I traveled in India some years ago and saw people melting down plastic in cauldrons outside their buildings, for recycling purposes, and it smelled like this so that's all that comes to mind to explain it.  Anyway, I left it out of its packaging to air out for a few days, and as a result it made the room smell like faintly of burned plastic and smoke.  The smell of the product did not improve over several days of being open to the air. So I will return it. Last thing I want is to put it in my carry-on, and arrive at a business trip with my business suits smelling like I got them at a fire damage salvage sale.  Too bad, because the case itself is a nice design idea, with little pockets and adjustable compartments inside where I could have stashed all those odds and ends (cell phone, blackberry, small camera, etc) that all currently have their own separate storage cases. For a similar price, I'll probably get a CaseLogic brand product at Target or similar store instead."
20184,1,N,Books,0802120555,Full Service: My Adventures in Hollywood and the Secret Sex Live of the Stars,Sorry I Purchased This,"I wish I had never purchased this book. Curiosity killed the cat, and now I am guilty of helping this man out financially. At first glance it seemed to be enjoyable and a very easy read.  It won't take the reader long to see how self absorbed this man is.<br /><br />I'm sure that some of this is factual, however it is quite apparent that tooting his own horn is more important than anything an actor or actress can contribute. There are many instances in this book where Mr. Bowers seems to take full credit for the achievement of others. One of the most glaring is when he seems to think if it weren't for him his friend would not have won the Oscar. There are many instances like this through out the book, and it doesn't take someone too long to realize that basically this man is a huge bore.<br /><br />He claims to have no regrets for his life and I believe it.  A long standing marriage to an understanding spouse and the loss of a daughter don't take up too much space in this book.It's all about the pursuit of tail for either himself or all his wonderful &#34;friends&#34; in Hollywood.  Anything of any real importance seems to be thrown in as an after thought.  This is his book and it is all about him.  Stories he relates about his &#34;friends&#34; is pretty much common knowledge to the average reader. Most, if not all of his &#34;friends&#34; are no longer living, so it's his word against theirs.<br /><br />To sum up this book, if you want to call it that, I guess you could say his life is fairly shallow. I'm sure he probably orchestrated hook ups for celebrities in his prime. Okay, he was a pimp. What I find some comfort in is the fact that all his Hollywood &#34;friends&#34; used him  as much as he liked using others. He states many times in the book that what he did for all those years ( pimping), was to make others happy. In his own mind I'm sure he believes this. Every thing he got in this life was on the backs of others.  If these celebrities were really his friends as he emphatically states again and again, he would have kept his mouth closed."

The blue looked great on my blood bay saddlebred, it held up really well, I just had to adjust it so it fit better, but the noseband didn't stay in one place & it slid down his nose. I really didn't like how my horse reacted to trying to train him in it, he leaned on it more than I wanted. I bought stiffer rope & made my own halter, which I like better, but this is good for someone who needs something softer but still wants the nose knots.<br /><br />The lead rope was to stiff & rough, I didn't like the feel of it at all. I used my own rope for it.<br /><br />Overall, it was ok, just not what I like."

IOW some discs may not support remaining time on the main title but things like extras may support it. If you activate remaining time in a extra, when you go back to the main title remaining will stick.<br />Another thing I like about the NS-50 and also NS-41(basically identical to the NS-50 from what I've found) is they both have full picture controls: Brightness, Contrast, Color, etc.<br />Like most all Sony DVD players this one has  a 6 disc resume feature that remembers where you left off for the last 6 discs where you've saved a resume(to not save a resume simply push STOP STOP before ejecting the disc). Resuming is as simple as inserting a disc and pressing PLAY or pushing PLAY when the tray is open and it will close and start at the resume point.<br />This player has PLAY, EJECT, STOP, PAUSE and SKIP forward and SKIP rev on the main unit, other features are accessed from the remote.<br />On the remote it has speed play where you can play a disc in anywhere from .6 to 1.4x speed with audio. Full slow motion as well as frame advance is also available, not to mention time search where you can easily enter any time and the player will jump to it.<br />I have several of these and they seem to last forever not to mention they are quite good at playing scratched discs as well as all burnt discs including DL's. Unfortunatly the only video format this player supports is MPEG2, the most common DVD standard, no Divx or other computer type formats."

Used it while making minor repairs on my 18 wheeler, and it proved an awesome wardrobe addition. I moistened it, and stayed cool in 107 degree heat. While I would love a 46""x46"" size, due to me having a larger neck, and head. It will definitely be included in my clothing bag. After the first wash, It did not have any extensive color wash off. And the color stayed the same shade. I ordered purple, and will be definitely ordering a variety of colors. Giving 4 out of 5 stars. It would have been 5, but the 42""X42"" size is going to prove to be an issue when I go for a complete head cover. Otherwise. Great product."

I tried to get it all out..but it was quite difficult. Afterwards, it looked safe to wear them since the icky paint came off, but that was a big mistake. My ears turned green..just like when you buy a cheap ring. Its more disturbing when the green is inside your ear though. Sad.<br /><br />Basically..if you need these for a one-time event, they're good. Don't wear them more than once."

The Netflix app is so old it lacks all kinds of features that are commonplace with other Netflix boxes, like the ability to sequence to the next video in a series.  Each time we power up this puppy, we have to manually search through sometimes dozens of episodes we've already watched to get to the next one we haven't seen.  It doesn't even group the episodes into seasons (season 1, 2, etc.), you have to scroll through ALL of the episodes to get to the one you want.<br /><br />There are lots of other Netflix and Amazon gotcha's that make using it truly painful.  For example the Amazon app has no ""My list"", so you can't make any attempt at saving a favorite show for future viewing.  Ridiculous.<br /><br />It's not that I expect Vizio to compete head-on with Roku (for example) but they could at least try to keep current.<br /><br />As a plain old HD tv this unit is fine.<br /><br />My 2c.<br /><br />Further info, 9/16/2013: Just spoke with Vizo tech support.  According to him they have several different main versions of firmware, and they have to work ""hand in hand"" with each of the app providers (i.e. Netflix) to coordinate every update.  Long story short, they *may* get around to updating any particular firmware version at some point, but they are seriously behind at this time.  To me, sounds like a losing battle.

They look just like they're pictured but better. I received promptly, they came USPS and when I opened the package there was a blue box. Then inside the blue box, there was the display box with the jewelry. It had a little piece of ribbon  on the box to lift up the lid to the earrings.

20381,5,Y,Home Entertainment,B008EQ4BQG,Actiontec Ethernet over Coax Adapter Kit for Homes without MoCA Routers,Don't even worry about it.  This stuff works,"As mentioned by others, finally there is an in-home wiring system for high speed Internet in your house.  This system works and works well and is completely reliable, fast - everything you're looking for.  Don't even worry about any complexity of setup - this is just super easy to set up and it really works.  The package I got from Amazon was just a bubble wrap with the item, a short coax cable, a two-way 2Ghz splitter and a quick start guide.  If you want to plug it in as is and go it works fine. If you want to add encryption or pick a particular frequency to use, you need a setup utility that you have to download online.  I just Googled the brand and model number on the device and downloaded the setup utility with ease.  The utility is straight forward and obvious to use - you pick a frequency (I just picked SCAN) and if you want, encrypt your home signals with a numerical password.  That's all the utility does.  Not all home setups have the right kind of 2GHZ splitters throughout the house, so scan will pick a frequency for you your home wiring can handle.  If you want top speed, replace all your splitters with the 2GHz type and pick the highest frequency in the setup utility.  Can't say enough praise for this tech.  No worries.  This is the one to buy."

Bloodshot does what he does best and is designed for WIN in an unwinnable situation. Personally I thoroughly enjoy Bloodshot‚Äôs character and glad Valiant gave him a little side story of his own, which could of easily been absorbed into Unity. This volume covers Bloodshot #0 which is always fun to read and find out the backstory of a character.

On value I give 5 stars, so 4 stars overall.  Truth is, I bought this for my daughter's first phone and it's perfect for that.  I've played around with it quite a bit and it can handle any App we've thrown at it.  The screen is slightly smaller than a S4 or S3 and it's not as vivid, but you really don't notice unless you're running them side by side.  Camera is not super awesome, but is perfectly fine for a teenager or any casual user that's not expecting professional results from a phone camera.<br /><br />The quad core processor is very capable and doesn't get bogged down like other budget Androids.  Well worth the price. Best budget Android available in my opinion."

ALL... big mistake. The fabric is a bit itchy/scratchy as some other reviewers stated but not to the point that you would be scratching the whole time wearing it. You can choose to wear the halter strap or not. The print is beautiful, the length is nice about knee/calf depending on hieght. The tube is stretchy, just for regular sizes, not plus.

20592,3,Y,Home Entertainment,B00HPMCO46,SONY KDL40W600B 40-Inch 1080P 60Hz LED HDTV Black,Not sure how to rate.  Basically good product but annoying manufacturing flaw,"This is only my second LCD t.v. and my first edge-lit LED.  It is also the first time I bought a Sony television.  My wife wanted to try since she really buys into the idea that Sony is simply more dependable.  And we were both happily surprised to find this 40-inch LED at roughly the same price as the corresponding Samsung model.  I was a little worried given that it is a new model and not very much reviewed yet.  But, hey, Sony right?<br /><br />For the most part, it's a great set.  The apps work surprisingly well given how bad wifi streaming is on a lot of Smart televisions.  The picture is fantastic from the right distance.  Sound is strong.  4 HDMI ports is amazing along with 2 USB ports so you can power a chromecast without plugging it into the wall.  Set up was easy.  The set is incredibly light.  All the ports worked and the menus react quickly.<br /><br />There are two noteworthy problems.<br /><br />The first seems to be a design flaw.  The power supply plugs into the back of the television in a very insecure manner.  It just barely clicks into place and the slightest touch can jar it loose.  Once you're set up this may not be a problem, but if you ever have to mess with anything in the back of the set, it will turn off on you and the plug may just outright fall out of its place.  Kind of amazing give how basic &#34;power supply&#34; is to product design. The chord between the t.v. and the power brick is also way too short and if you place the t.v. on a somewhat tall t.v. stand, the brick will need to be taped to something or supported somehow.  This is only compounded by the problem with the plug as the weight of the brick will easily pull the plug out of the back of the t.v. if it isn't secured. So, electrical tape may be your t.v. companion!<br /><br />The second problem is more annoying and seems to be a manufacturing flaw in the set I was shipped, which is disappointing given that we went with Sony exactly to avoid just that.  There are visible blotches of light that appear near the bottom of the screen on any white or light-colored surface that is moving (like when watching a hockey game or soccer match).  It is very distracting in those situations but not noticeable in most others (like watching a movie).  You can also see them pretty clearly on any solid background that is somewhat light.  It's true that uneven light or backlight &#34;bleeding&#34; is fairly common in LED's, but amazingly, in this case, if you get close to the screen and look down toward the bottom edge, you can see a second screen behind the front panel, some sort of thin plastic screen that is meant to diffuse and distribute the light evenly.  You can see that is is curved away from the panel in one spot at the bottom, just to the right of the Sony logo.  It is supposed to be straight and flush against the edge and stretched tight.  It is also supposed to be invisible to the eye I would guess.  But instead it is sort of &#34;warped&#34; or wrinkled in this one place, or maybe just wasn't set in place properly so you can see it behind the main panel.  I'm pretty sure this wrinkle is causing the waves of uneven light just above it, along with a little dark splotch near that spot.<br /><br />It's only been two days and I don't think I'm going to exchange it.  It is only distracting in certain situations and some uneven lighting is just a common issue with edge-lit LEDs.  I figure that the next one will likely have some other slight issue or other and I don't care to be one of those Amazon customers that cycles through product after product over fairly minor glitches until I get one that is perfect, especially when it comes to something as finicky as the edge-lit LED t.v.s that seem to be a bit of a lottery.  But it is disappointing to see such an obvious and easily detectable manufacturing flaw as a warped diffusion (or whatever it is) screen show up in a product that is a pretty big ticket item for us ($500 is nothing to snuffle at).<br /><br/>I have no reason to think that this is a common issue and, in fact, searching around I've found no mention of anything like it with this or other models.<br /><br />Meanwhile our other t.v. is a five-year-old &#34;budget&#34; Samsung that has had a perfect picture from the moment we got it."

I didn't want a heavy, obnoxious looking one though, so I decided to go for something smaller but still noticeable. This was my Christmas present to myself, along with a few others, and it arrived a day right before Christmas so I was really happy about that. When I opened it up, I saw that it was small, a bit smaller than I had expected, but I liked it anyway. It took some adjusting but I had finally gotten the hang of it. It's so easy to adjust to your ear and I found it really comfortable. You hardly notice that it's on, once you get it on the right spot, and I wore this for my annual family Christmas dinner.

20618,3,Y,Home Entertainment,B0038JE07O,The Boxee Box by D-Link HD Streaming Media Player,The boxee is not a reliable product.,The idea of the boxy is great. For the most part it runs well. I can stream videos from my computer or internet to the boxee. Sometimes the system hangs when you are using it or it disconnects itself from the LAN. The main reason I bought this was to watch movies from a hard drive wired directly to the box and this works well but has a limit of 3 Tb. It took hours to find the right firmware to update the boxee and get it connected to the LAN. The video quality is really good. The remote control is a little awkward but works well. The box is small. People talk about it not fitting on a shelf. A DVD case is taller than the box. The HDMI cable it comes with is short. It should be close to your receiver. The weakest part of the boxee is the wireless connection and programming of the software.

Playback from blu ray discs has been outstanding.  2 issues with this unit have nothing to do with the unit itself but with delivery.  The unit was packed inadequately in the shipping box with it being free to slide around.  Given the state of the shipping box, I would say it was subject to a good deal of abuse during the shipping process which leads me to wonder if damage has been done to the unit (none observed at this time but only time will tell).  Secondly, it took from 2/16 until 2/24 for the unit to arrive in the Rochester NY area from Pennsylvania via USPS.  Overly long shipping time and apparently one of the reasons why the packages looks as beat as it did (any wonder why USPS has issues?)

I surveyed all (well....many of.....) the 32-inch HDTVs out there. At least the ones in the ""budget"" category.  I went to Best Buy.  Went to Wal-Mart.  I stood back.  I stared.  I reviewed specs and stats.  I vacillated between going ""cheap"" (a.k.a. ""no name"" or ""somewhat familiar"" name) and famous ""name brand"".  I run a moderately-sized independent inn  (hotel) with 20 rooms and needed to make a wise purchase.  I have a 65"" LG 3D TV at home purchased last Christmas through Amazon.  Love it...but after the ""dust settled"" in this 32-inch category.....I looked at prices and caught a sale at WallyWorld ($268)....with Best Buy matching it....I bought 20 of these babies.  Samsung....not LG.  WHY?..you ask?<br /><br />First....there is NO such thing as a non-""flimsy"" TV base.  After taking the very first one out of the box...I saw part of the ""shaky problem"".  The metal frame and the shiny black plastic overlay do not fit perfectly together with every TV.  NO BIGGIE.  I estimated the engineering issue at about 1/32""-1/64"" of ""play...front to back.  Solution? I got a cheap roll of RUBBER electrical tape (not vinyl), cut ONE 1-inch piece and tacked it on top of the base-bottom rubber pad (rear one).  VOILA.  No...more....wobble....or shake.  Sure....this COULD have been prevented with better production of the metal base and plastic molding....but what is....is.  C'mon people!  No need to bellyache....look for solutions!  It now has NO wobble.  Yeah...make sure that you ""crank"" in the 7 screws so they bottom out....and a slight extra crank.  You're done.  Attach your coax.....attach the power cord.....turn it on.....click...click....click.....wait for the channels to memorize (if you have cable, etc.) then wait the 10-15 minutes of plug-in-play programming to finish up.  Program the date and time.  Enjoy your TV.  Samsung has a great rating for a reason.  Clean.  Bright.  Crisp.<br /><br />Oh...the LG was my second choice....but I preferred the brightness/vibrancy of this Samsung.  Plus the ""swoopy"" design of the lower part of the TV frame in front seemed more ""modern"". I DO wish that there was a volume limiter option...but, alas....this is a consumer-grade TV...not an overpriced ""hotel grade"". SUPERB VALUE at this price point.  Oh....don't sweat the 60Hz vs. 120 or the 720p vs. 1080p.  At 32 inches.....your eyes/brain will HARDLY know the difference.  Sorta like the difference between 87 and 92 octane.  You'll hardly notice.  Except for the $50-$100 dollar difference.  I noticed THAT! BTW, there is NO ""tilt"" on this base.  I have NO idea where THAT previous comment came from....<br /><br />I may write more as time goes by.  For now....I have 12 more TVs to install.  Anyone want twenty-three 27-inch, 60lb CRT (tube) prehistoric TVs?  Goodwill, here I come....<br /><br />UPDATE 11/9/12:  I am still VERY please with this TV.  I have the open-box-to-all-set-up process down to 5 minutes (plus the self-programming which takes about 15 minutes).  Indeed, there is a consistent, very SLIGHT off-level issue with the stand base.  One 1-inch slice of rubber electrical tape on the REAR bottom pad is all it takes.  There are NO issues with ill-fitting screws AT ALL.  Just eat your spinach beforehand so you can put a bit of ""umph"" in your final twists - they are self-tapping. This is really a great bang-for-the-buck at $268 (WM)."

20757,3,N,Home Entertainment,B004SKBILS,Philips PB9011/37 9-Inch 1080p Portable DVD Player,"OK Blu-Ray/DVD players for the back seat, but a bit expensive","The Philips PB9011 portable Blu-Ray DVD Player is a pretty good option for the back seat of a car, but it doesn't offer much more than less expensive players unless you are committed to Blu-Ray discs.  Pros:  - They generally do what they are supposed. They provide an ok movie watching experience for the back seat.  - 9"" screens are on the bigger side for portable players intended for the car.  - The carrying case fits everything perfectly and easily. No jamming stuff into place or having to figure out what should go where. It really is well done. With kids, it is important that things can easily be put away properly.  - As the name says, it plays Blu-Ray discs. In reality, the quality on this player doesn't allow Blu-Rays do much more than a DVD, but if you already have a Blu-Ray disc, you can still play it in the car with the PB9011. In the past, we had to limit ourselves to DVD's just in case we wanted to watch the movie in the car at some point. Nice!  Cons:  - You can only watch one movie at a time. The second screen is only a slave to the primary. The other (much less expensive) portable DVD players that we have can work as a pair or independently.  - The volume control is a physical dial on the side of the player, so it can't be controlled by remote and it requires a little more fidgeting than a digital volume control.  - The sound is ok but not great. It sounds much more like mono than stereo and doesn't get very loud without deteriorating.  - The screen washes out in sunlight. In the back seat of a car, it is tough to control going into and out of sunlight. These screens don't do well with that.  - The cables are quite a mess in the back of the car, but that is hard to avoid with a pair of portable screens.  - The remote control feels flimsy. We'll see how it holds up.  - The screens don't tilt on their backings like our other players do. If the angle is off for the person watching the movie, you have to play with how it is strapped to the headrest insteadof just tilting it up or down."

The flattening panel in the front needs to fit you like a girdle and when it doesn't, there are pooches on both sides of it, and you, at the tummy.  Washing and drying on a hot setting doesn't do much, NYDJ recommends cold water. Washing in hot just relaxes the spandex and the shrinkage is just temporary from the cotton shrinking. I was also disappointed that they were NOT Skinny. Slim, yes, but not what I expected.  I couldn't return them because the return policy states that you can't open the package to try them on, and expect to return them. The one good thing is that NYDJ positions the back pockets closer together and this is more flattering on your rear. If the prices weren't so darn high, I would order the leggings, but not having a good experience the first time, I'll pass.  Too bad, I was excited to look great in them."

It is still working like a champ! I have never had a single problem with it. It is still used every day. Since then I have talked my parents into getting two and my roommate into getting two. They couldn't live without them now. I currently have 3 units. It made things so much less painful after the accident, not having to go from one VCR to another and try to keep track of the tapes and shows. What a nightmare. I love that I don't have to keep up with any schedule, program and channel changes as well. Tivo recognizes any changes made and adapts from season to season. Thank you for making a product that I use every single day. Tivo kept me connected to the rest of the world for a long time. It still does. I tried going to a cable company's DVR (If you want to call it that) and it was horrible. The product and customer service was far from that of Tivo's. I paid over $300 less than two weeks later to get away from them. Tivo customer service is better than ANY electronic company I have ever dealt with. Even my dad, a tough man to impress, is extremely happy with your product, service and customer care. The capacities of units have come a long way from the first incarnation. Cable and satellite companies will be chasing, and never reaching, Tivo forever. Have a happy day. :-)  Thank you for making a quality product that gets better with each model.

Good luck with the remote too - you have to be a yoga expert to control the thing.  The case doesn't fit it properly either, so if you hit a bump, the velcro won't hold it back and it'll flip forward.  I hate it.  I guess I'll be trying out the warranty, but guess what?  I replaced a Sylvania with this one, and that one also broke after a few months.  We follow installation instructions to the letter.  i thought this one might be different because of its decent reviews, but it was worse.  I suspect Sylvania paid for the good reviews on this item.<br /><br />EDIT:  Customer service on the warranty was awful.  AWFUL.  You have to pay to shipping and handling to return it, and $7 for them to return it to you.  And you get to speak with someone not in this country, who will make you repeat everything 150 times.

20849,4,N,Home Entertainment,B0076U29LK,Samsung HW-E450 Wireless AirTrack Sound Bar (Old Version),Weak Low End,"I purchased from Walmart for $250($268 after tax). Took me about 10 minutes to hook everything up -- sat back on the couch for an hour listening and adjusting levels with different movies/music. The system looks clean and goes well with my 46 inch Samsung. The remote that came with the speakers worked with my TV right out of the box -- and I like it better than my stock TV remote so I'll be using the new one from now on. I also like the USB plug on the right side of the bar so I can plug my phone in to charge or listen to music. I've been listening to music/movies for the last 4 hours and here's what I've noticed so far...<br /><br />Low Levels<br /> - Since the sub is so weak, you'll have to turn the sub to the highest setting if you really want to feel it in your bones. And when you crank a speaker up to the highest volume, you almost never get a clean sound. It's not HORRIBLE, but I feel like SAMSUNG really could have satisfied people a lot more if they included a more powerful sub. For movies it's not so bad, but the bass isn't crisp and sharp with songs that have a lot of kicks or 808's with low frequencies.<br /><br />Mids/Highs<br /> - The range of the actual sound bar itself is incredible...there's a real distinction between the mid/lower and highest frequencies which are all driven out at different angles so they hit your ears to closely resemble a 5.1 system. I did notice slight clipping noises when the upper range hit higher volumes though -- hopefully this will go away after the speakers get broken in. The sound really is beautiful though and I'm happy with the look/sound of the bar.<br /><br />I'll definitely enjoy these for now but I'm not impressed with the sub. I'm waiting for Vizio to release their new system which is supposed to be the next best thing since sliced bread. I'll compare the two and pick whichever ends up sounding better...but for now the E450's will be a huge upgrade from my stock TV speakers."

Believe me, paying less than 290.00 (which included free shipping and for some reason no sales tax was added) The picture has been crystal clear, sound quality is good (did purchase SONY sound bar system at the same time with the money I saved) Set-up was ridiculously easy (in my bedroom) and sha-zam! Apps have worked great so far, no problem with Netflix. Vizio was suppose to introduce the M series by the first quarter of the year, here it is almost June so lost my patience and took chance on the E series, no disappointments (but damn, when are they coming out with the M series)"
20851,5,N,Home Entertainment,B00CCYZ13S,VIZIO M501d-A2R 50-Inch 1080p 3D Smart LED  HDTV (2013 Model),WOW,"Purchased this to replace an aging 42 inch Panasonic Plasma.  The Plasma has been great but this new Vizio is absolutely amazing.  The 3D quality is stunning and the picture quality for regular 2D is outstanding.  I did quite a bit of research and boiled my choices down to LG, Panasonic Plasma, and the Vizio.  The LG looked good but the price difference was too great in my opinion.  I was leaning towards the Panasonic based on my excellent experience with the set I've owned for 10 years or so.  I went to an electronics store to see both the Vizio and Panasonic 3D and that sold me on the Vizio.  The only complaint I have is the remote which is terrible.  Fortunately I have a Harmony and that works well with the Vizio.  Buy this set.  You won't be sorry.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Now that I have owned this set for 3 plus months I would like to add to my initial review.  While the set is still very good in terms of viewing pleasure it has developed some bugs in the last month or so.  The first is I sometimes lose audio, generally when changing channels.  I change the channel and I hear a ""pop"" and then no audio.  I have to turn off the set and then back on to get the audio working.  I use a Samsung Soundbar connected to the TV via HDMI Arc which works very well.  The TV completely controls Power on, off, etc.  The issue is not a problem with the Soundbar as I experienced the same thing when the TV was connected to a BOSE Cinemate system.<br /><br />The second glitch, which is far more annoying, is the TV sometimes fails to power up.  I hit my Harmony remote to Power Up the TV, Soundbar, and Cable Box and the TV fails to come on.  I have tried pushing the manual button on the back of the set but no joy.  The only way to get the TV to power up is to pull the power cord, wait 10 seconds or so, and then plug it back in.  Then it powers up and plays without any issues.<br /><br />I did get an extended warranty with the set which I think I will be using in the near future.  This is my first Vizio, and while it has many great features, I fear it is not going to be very dependable over time.  We shall see."

And, honestly I don't regularly need everything in it.<br /><br />This cute little wallet holds my bus pass, my ID, some cash and my debit card perfectly. When it is snapped shut everything is held securely in place.<br /><br />It even has a small zipper pocket.<br /><br />And, it is gold which those into Feng shui recommend as the most auspicious wallet color. ;)<br /><br />Finally, I was pleasantly surprised at the strength of the attached key ring."

Unfortunately for me,  the polyester outer shell rubs against my scarf or coat and makes a lot of noise. If that is a concern for  you,  I would recommend the Tec Fleece or the  Chesterfield -- I think I had the chesterfield last time"

Quote: &#34;They are wonderful&#34;. We both love the look of these slippers, pretty and &#34;classy&#34;. They are a replacement for a previous pair of Acorn slippers that I bought her several years ago and that she had worn completely out. These are better looking, and manifest the same quality found in her previous pair. In agreement with some other reviews:<br /><br />(1) My wife has already remarked that she doesn't need socks with these; they are so warm, soft, and snuggly.<br /><br />(2) Forewarned by other reviews, I moved up in size a step to a &#34;Large&#34; and these fit my size 7.5 wife's feet perfectly.<br /><br />Our experience with Acorn slippers is that while they are a bit &#34;pricey&#34;, they more than return the investment in appearance, comfort and life."

20959,5,N,Shoes,B00ALSO8V8,"Salomon Men's Fell Raiser Trail Running Shoe,Black/Autobahn/Green,9.5 M US",Ideal for Obstacle Course Racing,"These have been my go to shoes for Mud Runs (aka Obstacle Course Races) for the past 2 years as I'm still using the same pair and I probably do about 10-12 OCR's a year. These shoes are liking having 4WD for your feet when ascending and descending, steep, slippery, muddy slopes which is exactly what they've been bred for. I like them better than my Salomon SpeedCross 3's for OCR's because of the Fellraisers lower drop and more stable base. For regular trail races, I prefer my SpeedCross 3's. I can't recommend these enough if you are planning to use them for Mud Runs. If you're just looking to run gravel and relatively smooth, non-tehcnical trails, you may want to look at a shoe that may provide a bit more comfort as the ultra aggressive lugs on the Fell Raiser don't necessarily lend the shoe to the softest of feels, but they are still adequately cushioned."
