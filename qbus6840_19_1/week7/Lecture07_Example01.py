To run this program, you must update statsmodels to the newest version 0.8

# We will use statsmodel's time series plots to draw ACF etc.

from pandas.plotting import autocorrelation_plot
# Or we can use pandas to draw ACF
 
# This data is of type DataFrame with only one column
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
# We make it as a Series by taking out the column
data = data['Data']

# We calculate difference series, data[1]-data[0], data[2]-data[1],...
diff_data = data.diff()    
# Checking the first entry in diff_data

# If we dont do this, what will happen for the following codes

# Plot our data
plt.plot(data)
plt.figure()
plt.plot(diff_data)

# Plot the ACF for the data. This call opens a new plot
smt.graphics.tsa.plot_acf(data, lags=30, alpha = 0.05)
# lags = 30 means drawing 30 lags
# Here alpha=.05, 95% confidence intervals are returned 
# where the standard deviation is computed according to 
# Bartlettâ€™s formula.

# You may change 0.05 to other values for alpha to see what will happen

# Plot the ACF for the data. This call opens a new plot
# smt.graphics.tsa.plot_pacf(data, lags=30, alpha=0.05)

# For differenced time series
smt.graphics.tsa.plot_acf(diff_data, lags=30, alpha = 0.05)
#plt.figure()
#smt.graphics.tsa.plot_pacf(diff_data, lags=30, alpha = 0.05)

# Use pandas for ACF, but not plot function for PACF
plt.figure()  # We need prepare the figure
autocorrelation_plot(data)
