# Plot our data
plt.plot(data)
 
# Plot the ACF for the data. This call opens a new plot
smt.graphics.tsa.plot_acf(data, lags=30, alpha = 0.05)
# lags = 30 means drawing 30 lags
# Here alpha=.05, 95% confidence intervals are returned 
# where the standard deviation is computed according to 
# Bartlettâ€™s formula.

# You may change 0.05 to other values for alpha to see what will happen

# Plot the ACF for the data. This call opens a new plot
